QUINT: On Query-Specific Optimal Networks,2016,"Measuring node proximity on large scale networks is a fundamental building block in many application domains, ranging from computer vision, e-commerce, social networks, software engineering, disaster management to biology and epidemiology. The state of the art (e.g., random walk based methods) typically assumes the input network is given a priori, with the known network topology and the associated edge weights. A few recent works aim to further infer the optimal edge weights based on the side information. This paper generalizes the challenge in multiple dimensions, aiming to learn optimal networks for node proximity measures. First (optimization scope), our proposed formulation explores a much larger parameter space, so that it is able to simultaneously infer the optimal network topology and the associated edge weights. This is important as a noisy or missing edge could greatly mislead the network node proximity measures. Second (optimization granularity), while all the existing works assume one common optimal network, be it given as the input or learned by the algorithms, exists for all queries, our method performs optimization at a much finer granularity, essentially being able to infer an optimal network that is specific to a given query. Third (optimization efficiency), we carefully design our algorithms with a linear complexity wrt the neighborhood size of the user preference set. We perform extensive empirical evaluations on a diverse set of 10+ real networks, which show that the proposed algorithms (1) consistently outperform the existing methods on all six commonly used metrics; (2) empirically scale sub-linearly to billion-scale networks and (3) respond in a fraction of a second.",KDD
Street Smarts: Measuring Intercity Road Quality Using Deep Learning On Satellite Imagery,2019,"High-quality roads are the scaffolding for prosperous and healthy societies, and accordingly garner huge investments from governments every year. However, current techniques to monitor those investments tend to be time-consuming, laborious, and expensive, placing them out of reach for many developing regions. In this work, we develop a model for monitoring the quality of road infrastructure using satellite imagery, enabling much larger scale and much lower costs than are achievable with current methods. For this task, we harness two trends: the increasing availability of high-resolution, often-updated satellite imagery, and substantial improvement in accuracy and performance of neural network-based methods for executing computer vision tasks. In this study, we train a model for intercity road quality prediction using a unique dataset of road quality measurement labels (57 roads, total length is 7000km) throughout the Republic of Kenya combined with corresponding 50cm resolution satellite imagery. Using a variety of neural network architectures, we create and evaluate regression models for predicting road quality. Our results show a best-case RÂ² value of 0.79 for the regression problem using a standard train-test split and an RÂ² value of 0.35 for the substantially harder held-out regression problem which has the added potential to generalize more readily to other contexts. We further demonstrate the potential of our measurement technique with a large-scale case study (for 322 towns throughout Kenya) that shows a positive relationship between incoming road quality and nighttime illumination, a common proxy measurement for local economic activity. These results indicate the possibility to measure road quality at an unprecedented scale, providing insight into the contribution of high-quality roads to many societal development indicators.",COMPASS
MetaPred: Meta-Learning for Clinical Risk Prediction with Limited Patient Electronic Health Records,2019,"In recent years, large amounts of health data, such as patient Electronic Health Records (EHR), are becoming readily available. This provides an unprecedented opportunity for knowledge discovery and data mining algorithms to dig insights from them, which can, later on, be helpful to the improvement of the quality of care delivery. Predictive modeling of clinical risks, including in-hospital mortality, hospital readmission, chronic disease onset, condition exacerbation, etc., from patient EHR, is one of the health data analytic problems that attract lots of the interests. The reason is not only because the problem is important in clinical settings, but also is challenging when working with EHR such as sparsity, irregularity, temporality, etc. Different from applications in other domains such as computer vision and natural language processing, the data samples in medicine (patients) are relatively limited, which creates lots of troubles for building effective predictive models, especially for complicated ones such as deep learning. In this paper, we propose~\textttMetaPred, a meta-learning framework for clinical risk prediction from longitudinal patient EHR. In particular, in order to predict the target risk with limited data samples, we train a meta-learner from a set of related risk prediction tasks which learns how a good predictor is trained. The meta-learned can then be directly used in target risk prediction, and the limited available samples in the target domain can be used for further fine-tuning the model performance. The effectiveness of \textttMetaPred is tested on a real patient EHR repository from Oregon Health & Science University. We are able to demonstrate that with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) as base predictors, \textttMetaPred can achieve much better performance for predicting target risk with low resources comparing with the predictor trained on the limited samples available for this risk alone.",KDD
Coupling Spatiotemporal Disease Modeling with Diagnosis,2012,"Modelling the density of an infectious disease in space and time is a task generally carried out separately from the diagnosis of that disease in individuals. These two inference problems are complementary, however: diagnosis of disease can be done more accurately if prior information from a spatial risk model is employed, and in turn a disease density model can benefit from the incorporation of rich symptomatic information rather than simple counts of presumed cases of infection. We propose a unifying framework for both of these tasks, and illustrate it with the case of malaria. To do this we first introduce a state space model of malaria spread, and secondly a computer vision based system for detecting plasmodium in microscopical blood smear images, which can be run on location-aware mobile devices. We demonstrate the tractability of combining both elements and the improvement in accuracy this brings about.",AAAI
AffinityNet: Semi-Supervised Few-Shot Learning for Disease Type Prediction,2019,"While deep learning has achieved great success in computer vision and many other fields, currently it does not work very well on patient genomic data with the Ã¢â¬Åbig p, small NÃ¢â¬Â problem (i.e., a relatively small number of samples with highdimensional features). In order to make deep learning work with a small amount of training data, we have to design new models that facilitate few-shot learning. Here we present the Affinity Network Model (AffinityNet), a data efficient deep learning model that can learn from a limited number of training examples and generalize well. The backbone of the AffinityNet model consists of stacked k-Nearest-Neighbor (kNN) attention pooling layers. The kNN attention pooling layer is a generalization of the Graph Attention Model (GAM), and can be applied to not only graphs but also any set of objects regardless of whether a graph is given or not. As a new deep learning module, kNN attention pooling layers can be plugged into any neural network model just like convolutional layers. As a simple special case of kNN attention pooling layer, feature attention layer can directly select important features that are useful for classification tasks. Experiments on both synthetic data and cancer genomic data from TCGA projects show that our AffinityNet model has better generalization power than conventional neural network models with little training data.",AAAI
Quantifying Uncertainty in Discrete-Continuous and Skewed Data with Bayesian Deep Learning,2018,"Deep Learning (DL) methods have been transforming computer vision with innovative adaptations to other domains including climate change. For DL to pervade Science and Engineering (S&EE) applications where risk management is a core component, well-characterized uncertainty estimates must accompany predictions. However, S&E observations and model-simulations often follow heavily skewed distributions and are not well modeled with DL approaches, since they usually optimize a Gaussian, or Euclidean, likelihood loss. Recent developments in Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL), which attempts to capture uncertainties from noisy observations, aleatoric, and from unknown model parameters, epistemic, provide us a foundation. Here we present a discrete-continuous BDL model with Gaussian and lognormal likelihoods for uncertainty quantification (UQ). We demonstrate the approach by developing UQ estimates on ""DeepSD'', a super-resolution based DL model for Statistical Downscaling (SD) in climate applied to precipitation, which follows an extremely skewed distribution. We find that the discrete-continuous models outperform a basic Gaussian distribution in terms of predictive accuracy and uncertainty calibration. Furthermore, we find that the lognormal distribution, which can handle skewed distributions, produces quality uncertainty estimates at the extremes. Such results may be important across S&E, as well as other domains such as finance and economics, where extremes are often of significant interest. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this is the first UQ model in SD where both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties are characterized.",KDD
Fine-Grained Car Detection for Visual Census Estimation,2017,"Targeted socio-economic policies require an accurate understanding of a countryÃ¢â¬â¢s demographic makeup. To that end, the United States spends more than 1 billion dollars a year gathering census data such as race, gender, education, occupation and unemployment rates. Compared to the traditional method of collecting surveys across many years which is costly and labor intensive, data-driven, machine learning-driven approaches are cheaper and fasterÃ¢â¬âwith the potential ability to detect trends in close to real time. In this work, we leverage the ubiquity of Google Street View images and develop a computer vision pipeline to predict income, per capita carbon emission, crime rates and other city attributes from a single source of publicly available visual data. We first detect cars in 50 million images across 200 of the largest US cities and train a model to predict demographic attributes using the detected cars. To facilitate our work, we have collected the largest and most challenging fine-grained dataset reported to date consisting of over 2600 classes of cars comprised of images from Google Street View and other web sources, classified by car experts to account for even the most subtle of visual differences. We use this data to construct the largest scale fine-grained detection system reported to date. Our prediction results correlate well with ground truth income data (r=0.82), Massachusetts department of vehicle registration, and sources investigating crime rates, income segregation, per capita carbon emission, and other market research. Finally, we learn interesting relationships between cars and neighborhoods allowing us to perform the first large scale sociological analysis of cities using computer vision techniques.",AAAI
Beyond Speech: Generalizing D-Vectors for Biometric Verification,2019,"Deep learning based automatic feature extraction methods have radically transformed speaker identification and facial recognition. Current approaches are typically specialized for individual domains, such as Deep Vectors (D-Vectors) for speaker identification. We provide two distinct contributions: a generalized framework for biometric verification inspired by D-Vectors and novel models that outperform current stateof-the-art approaches. Our approach supports substitution of various feature extraction models and improves the robustness of verification tests across domains. We demonstrate the framework and models for two different behavioral biometric verification problems: keystroke and mobile gait. We present a comprehensive empirical analysis comparing our framework to the state-of-the-art in both domains. Our models perform verification with higher accuracy using orders of magnitude less data than state-of-the-art approaches in both domains. We believe that the combination of high accuracy and practical data requirements will enable application of behavioral biometric models outside of the laboratory in support of much-needed improvements to cyber security.",AAAI
Maestoso: An Intelligent Educational Sketching Tool for Learning Music Theory,2015,"Learning music theory not only has practical benefits for musicians to write, perform, understand, and express music better, but also for both non-musicians to improve critical thinking, math analytical skills, and music appreciation. However, current external tools applicable for learning music theory through writing when human instruction is unavailable are either limited in feedback, lacking a written modality, or assuming already strong familiarity of music theory concepts. In this paper, we describe Maestoso, an educational tool for novice learners to learn music theory through sketching practice of quizzed music structures. Maestoso first automatically recognizes students' sketched input of quizzed concepts, then relies on existing sketch and gesture recognition techniques to automatically recognize the input, and finally generates instructor-emulated feedback. From our evaluations, we demonstrate that Maestoso performs reasonably well on recognizing music structure elements and that novice students can comfortably grasp introductory music theory in a single session.",AAAI
Social Role-Aware Emotion Contagion in Image Social Networks,2016,"Psychological theories suggest that emotion represents the state of mind and instinctive responses of oneÃ¢â¬â¢s cognitive system (Cannon 1927). Emotions are a complex state of feeling that results in physical and psychological changes that influence our behavior. In this paper, we study an interesting problem of emotion contagion in social networks. In particular, by employing an image social network (Flickr) as the basis of our study, we try to unveil how usersÃ¢â¬â¢ emotional statuses influence each other and how usersÃ¢â¬â¢ positions in the social network affect their influential strength on emotion. We develop a probabilistic framework to formalize the problem into a role-aware contagion model. The model is able to predict usersÃ¢â¬â¢ emotional statuses based on their historical emotional statuses and social structures. Experiments on a large Flickr dataset show that the proposed model significantly outperforms (+31% in terms of F1-score) several alternative methods in predicting usersÃ¢â¬â¢ emotional status. We also discover several intriguing phenomena. For example, the probability that a user feels happy is roughly linear to the number of friends who are also happy; but taking a closer look, the happiness probability is superlinear to the number of happy friends who act as opinion leaders (Page et al. 1999) in the network and sublinear in the number of happy friends who span structural holes (Burt 2001). This offers a new opportunity to understand the underlying mechanism of emotional contagion in online social networks.",AAAI
Extracting Optimal Performance from Dynamic Time Warping,2016,"Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a distance measure that compares two time series after optimally aligning them. DTW is being used for decades in thousands of academic and industrial projects despite the very expensive computational complexity, O(n2). These applications include data mining, image processing, signal processing, robotics and computer graphics among many others. In spite of all this research effort, there are many myths and misunderstanding about DTW in the literature, for example ""it is too slow to be useful"" or ""the warping window size does not matter much."" In this tutorial, we correct these misunderstandings and we summarize the research efforts in optimizing both the efficiency and effectiveness of both the basic DTW algorithm, and of the higher-level algorithms that exploit DTW such as similarity search, clustering and classification. We will discuss variants of DTW such as constrained DTW, multidimensional DTW and asynchronous DTW, and optimization techniques such as lower bounding, early abandoning, run-length encoding, bounded approximation and hardware optimization. We will discuss a multitude of application areas including physiological monitoring, social media mining, activity recognition and animal sound processing. The optimization techniques are generalizable to other domains on various data types and problems.",KDD
Finding Similar Exercises in Online Education Systems,2018,"In online education systems, finding similar exercises is a fundamental task of many applications, such as exercise retrieval and student modeling. Several approaches have been proposed for this task by simply using the specific textual content (e.g. the same knowledge concepts or the similar words) in exercises. However, the problem of how to systematically exploit the rich semantic information embedded in multiple heterogenous data (e.g. texts and images) to precisely retrieve similar exercises remains pretty much open. To this end, in this paper, we develop a novel Multimodal Attention-based Neural Network (MANN) framework for finding similar exercises in large-scale online education systems by learning a unified semantic representation from the heterogenous data. In MANN, given exercises with texts, images and knowledge concepts, we first apply a convolutional neural network to extract image representations and use an embedding layer for representing concepts. Then, we design an attention-based long short-term memory network to learn a unified semantic representation of each exercise in a multimodal way. Here, two attention strategies are proposed to capture the associations of texts and images, texts and knowledge concepts, respectively. Moreover, with a Similarity Attention, the similar parts in each exercise pair are also measured. Finally, we develop a pairwise training strategy for returning similar exercises. Extensive experimental results on real-world data clearly validate the effectiveness and the interpretation power of MANN.",KDD
Ranking Distillation: Learning Compact Ranking Models With High Performance for Recommender System,2018,"We propose a novel way to train ranking models, such as recommender systems, that are both effective and efficient. Knowledge distillation (KD) was shown to be successful in image recognition to achieve both effectiveness and efficiency. We propose a KD technique for learning to rank problems, called ranking distillation (RD). Specifically, we train a smaller student model to learn to rank documents/items from both the training data and the supervision of a larger teacher model. The student model achieves a similar ranking performance to that of the large teacher model, but its smaller model size makes the online inference more efficient. RD is flexible because it is orthogonal to the choices of ranking models for the teacher and student. We address the challenges of RD for ranking problems. The experiments on public data sets and state-of-the-art recommendation models showed that RD achieves its design purposes: the student model learnt with RD has less than an half size of the teacher model while achieving a ranking performance similar tothe teacher model and much better than the student model learnt without RD.",KDD
Pre-Symptomatic Prediction of Plant Drought Stress Using Dirichlet-Aggregation Regression on Hyperspectral Images,2012,"Pre-symptomatic drought stress prediction is of great relevance in precision plant protection, ultimately helping to meet the challenge of ""How to feed a hungry world?"". Unfortunately, it also presents unique computational problems in scale and interpretability: it is a temporal, large-scale prediction task, e.g., when monitoring plants over time using hyperspectral imaging, and features are `things' with a `biological' meaning and interpretation and not just mathematical abstractions computable for any data. In this paper we propose Dirichlet-aggregation regression (DAR) to meet the challenge. DAR represents all data by means of convex combinations of only few extreme ones computable in linear time and easy to interpret.Then, it puts a Gaussian process prior on the Dirichlet distributions induced on the simplex spanned by the extremes. The prior can be a function of any observed meta feature such as time, location, type of fertilization, and plant species. We evaluated DAR on two hyperspectral image series of plants over time with about 2 (resp. 5.8) Billion matrix entries. The results demonstrate that DAR can be learned efficiently and predicts stress well before it becomes visible to the human eye.",AAAI
Deep Multi-View Spatial-Temporal Network for Taxi Demand Prediction,2018,"Taxi demand prediction is an important building block to enabling intelligent transportation systems in a smart city. An accurate prediction model can help the city pre-allocate resources to meet travel demand and to reduce empty taxis on streets which waste energy and worsen the traffic congestion. With the increasing popularity of taxi requesting services such as Uber and Didi Chuxing (in China), we are able to collect large-scale taxi demand data continuously. How to utilize such big data to improve the demand prediction is an interesting and critical real-world problem. Traditional demand prediction methods mostly rely on time series forecasting techniques, which fail to model the complex non-linear spatial and temporal relations. Recent advances in deep learning have shown superior performance on traditionally challenging tasks such as image classification by learning the complex features and correlations from large-scale data. This breakthrough has inspired researchers to explore deep learning techniques on traffic prediction problems. However, existing methods on traffic prediction have only considered spatial relation (e.g., using CNN) or temporal relation (e.g., using LSTM) independently. We propose a Deep Multi-View Spatial-Temporal Network (DMVST-Net) framework to model both spatial and temporal relations. Specifically, our proposed model consists of three views: temporal view (modeling correlations between future demand values with near time points via LSTM), spatial view (modeling local spatial correlation via local CNN), and semantic view (modeling correlations among regions sharing similar temporal patterns). Experiments on large-scale real taxi demand data demonstrate effectiveness of our approach over state-of-the-art methods.",AAAI
An integrated framework for suicide risk prediction,2013,"Suicide is a major concern in society. Despite of great attention paid by the community with very substantive medico-legal implications, there has been no satisfying method that can reliably predict the future attempted or completed suicide. We present an integrated machine learning framework to tackle this challenge. Our proposed framework consists of a novel feature extraction scheme, an embedded feature selection process, a set of risk classifiers and finally, a risk calibration procedure. For temporal feature extraction, we cast the patient's clinical history into a temporal image to which a bank of one-side filters are applied. The responses are then partly transformed into mid-level features and then selected in l1-norm framework under the extreme value theory. A set of probabilistic ordinal risk classifiers are then applied to compute the risk probabilities and further re-rank the features. Finally, the predicted risks are calibrated. Together with our Australian partner, we perform comprehensive study on data collected for the mental health cohort, and the experiments validate that our proposed framework outperforms risk assessment instruments by medical practitioners.",KDD
Learning Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for X-Ray Protein Crystallization Image Analysis,2016,"Obtaining a protein's 3D structure is crucial to the understanding of its functions and interactions with other proteins. It is critical to accelerate the protein crystallization process with improved accuracy for understanding cancer and designing drugs. Systematic high-throughput approaches in protein crystallization have been widely applied, generating a large number of protein crystallization-trial images. Therefore, an efficient and effective automatic analysis for these images is a top priority. In this paper, we present a novel system, CrystalNet, for automatically labeling outcomes of protein crystallization-trial images. CrystalNet is a deep convolutional neural network that automatically extracts features from X-ray protein crystallization images for classification. We show that (1) CrystalNet can provide real-time labels for crystallization images effectively, requiring approximately 2 seconds to provide labels for all 1536 images of crystallization microassay on each plate; (2) compared with the state-of-the-art classification systems in crystallization image analysis, our technique demonstrates an improvement of 8% in accuracy, and achieve 90.8% accuracy in classification. As a part of the high-throughput pipeline which generates millions of images a year, CrystalNet can lead to a substantial reduction of labor-intensive screening.",AAAI
Deep Mixture Point Processes: Spatio-temporal Event Prediction with Rich Contextual Information,2019,"Predicting when and where events will occur in cities, like taxi pick-ups, crimes, and vehicle collisions, is a challenging and important problem with many applications in fields such as urban planning, transportation optimization and location-based marketing. Though many point processes have been proposed to model events in a continuous spatio-temporal space, none of them allow for the consideration of the rich contextual factors that affect event occurrence, such as weather, social activities, geographical characteristics, and traffic. In this paper, we propose DMPP (Deep Mixture Point Processes), a point process model for predicting spatio-temporal events with the use of rich contextual information; a key advance is its incorporation of the heterogeneous and high-dimensional context available in image and text data. Specifically, we design the intensity of our point process model as a mixture of kernels, where the mixture weights are modeled by a deep neural network. This formulation allows us to automatically learn the complex nonlinear effects of the contextual factors on event occurrence. At the same time, this formulation makes analytical integration over the intensity, which is required for point process estimation, tractable. We use real-world data sets from different domains to demonstrate that DMPP has better predictive performance than existing methods.",KDD
Adversarial Detection with Model Interpretation,2018,"Machine learning (ML) systems have been increasingly applied in web security applications such as spammer detection, malware detection and fraud detection. These applications have an intrinsic adversarial nature where intelligent attackers can adaptively change their behaviors to avoid being detected by the deployed detectors. Existing efforts against adversaries are usually limited by the type of applied ML models or the specific applications such as image classification. Additionally, the working mechanisms of ML models usually cannot be well understood by users, which in turn impede them from understanding the vulnerabilities of models nor improving their robustness. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we propose to investigate whether model interpretation could potentially help adversarial detection. Specifically, we develop a novel adversary-resistant detection framework by utilizing the interpretation of ML models. The interpretation process explains the mechanism of how the target ML model makes prediction for a given instance, thus providing more insights for crafting adversarial samples. The robustness of detectors is then improved through adversarial training with the adversarial samples. A data-driven method is also developed to empirically estimate costs of adversaries in feature manipulation. Our approach is model-agnostic and can be applied to various types of classification models. Our experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of interpretation-based attacks and how estimated feature manipulation cost would affect the behavior of adversaries.",KDD
Multiple Instance Learning-Based Birdsong Classification Using Unsupervised Recording Segmentation,2015,"Traditional techniques for monitoring wildlife populations are temporally and spatially limited. Alternatively, in order to quickly and accurately extract information about the current state of the environment, tools for processing and recognition of acoustic signals can be used. In the past, a number of research studies on automatic classification of species through their vocalizations have been undertaken. In many of them, however, the segmentation applied in the preprocessing stage either implies human effort or is insufficiently described to be reproduced. Therefore, it might be unfeasible in real conditions. Particularly, this paper is focused on the extraction of local information as units --called instances-- from audio recordings. The methodology for instance extraction consists in the segmentation carried out using image processing techniques on spectrograms and the estimation of a needed threshold by the Otsu's method. The multiple instance classification (MIC) approach is used for the recognition of the sound units. A public data set was used for the experiments. The proposed unsupervised segmentation method has a practical advantage over the compared supervised method, which requires the training from manually segmented spectrograms. Results show that there is no significant difference between the proposed method and its baseline. Therefore, it is shown that the proposed approach is feasible to design an automatic recognition system of recordings which only requires, as training information, labeled examples of audio recordings.",IJCAI
Pathological Evidence Exploration in Deep Retinal Image Diagnosis,2019,"Though deep learning has shown successful performance in classifying the label and severity stage of certain disease, most of them give few evidence on how to make prediction. Here, we propose to exploit the interpretability of deep learning application in medical diagnosis. Inspired by KochÃ¢â¬â¢s Postulates, a well-known strategy in medical research to identify the property of pathogen, we define a pathological descriptor that can be extracted from the activated neurons of a diabetic retinopathy detector. To visualize the symptom and feature encoded in this descriptor, we propose a GAN based method to synthesize pathological retinal image given the descriptor and a binary vessel segmentation. Besides, with this descriptor, we can arbitrarily manipulate the position and quantity of lesions. As verified by a panel of 5 licensed ophthalmologists, our synthesized images carry the symptoms that are directly related to diabetic retinopathy diagnosis. The panel survey also shows that our generated images is both qualitatively and quantitatively superior to existing methods.",AAAI
Understanding atrophy trajectories in alzheimer's disease using association rules on MRI images,2011,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with progressive cognitive decline leading to dementia. The atrophy/loss of brain structure as seen on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is strongly correlated with the severity of the cognitive impairment in AD. In this paper, we set out to find associations between predefined regions of the brain (regions of interest; ROIs) and the severity of the disease. Specifically, we use these associations to address two important issues in AD: (i) typical versus atypical atrophy patterns and (ii) the origin and direction of progression of atrophy, which is currently under debate.
 We observed that each AD-related ROI is associated with a wide range of severity and that the difference between ROIs is merely a difference in severity distribution. To model differences between the severity distribution of a subpopulation (with significant atrophy in certain ROIs) and the severity distribution of the entire population, we developed the concept of Distributional Association Rules. Using the Distributional Association Rules, we clustered ROIs into disease subsystems. We define a disease subsystem as a contiguous set of ROIs that are collectively implicated in AD. AD is known to be heterogeneous in the sense that multiple sets of ROIs may be related to the disease in a population. We proposed an enhancement to the association rule mining where the algorithm only discovers association rules with ROIs that form an approximately contiguous volume. Next, we applied these association rules to infer the direction of disease progression based on the support measures of the association rules. We also developed a novel statistical test to determine the statistical significance of the discovered direction.
 We evaluated the proposed method on the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) prospective patient cohorts. The key achievements of the methodology is that it accurately identified larger disease subsystems implicated in typical and atypical AD and it successfully mapped the directions of disease progression.
 The wealth of data available in Radiology gives rise to opportunities for applying this methodology to map out the trajectory of several other diseases, e.g. other neuro-degenerative diseases and cancers, most notably, breast cancer. The applicability of this method is not limited to image data, as associating predictors with severity provides valuable information in most areas of medicine as well as other industries.",KDD
Building Trust in Deep Learning System towards Automated Disease Detection,2019,"Though deep learning systems have achieved high accuracy in detecting diseases from medical images, few such systems have been deployed in highly automated disease screening settings due to lack of trust in how well these systems can generalize to out-of-datasets. We propose to use uncertainty estimates of the deep learning systemÃ¢â¬â¢s prediction to know when to accept or to disregard its prediction. We evaluate the effectiveness of using such estimates in a real-life application for the screening of diabetic retinopathy. We also generate visual explanation of the deep learning system to convey the pixels in the image that influences its decision. Together, these reveal the deep learning systemÃ¢â¬â¢s competency and limits to the human, and in turn the human can know when to trust the deep learning system.",AAAI
Volumetric ConvNets with Mixed Residual Connections for Automated Prostate Segmentation from 3D MR Images,2017,"Automated prostate segmentation from 3D MR images is very challenging due to large variations of prostate shape and indistinct prostate boundaries. We propose a novel volumetric convolutional neural network (ConvNet) with mixed residual connections to cope with this challenging problem. Compared with previous methods, our volumetric ConvNet has two compelling advantages. First, it is implemented in a 3D manner and can fully exploit the 3D spatial contextual information of input data to perform efficient, precise and volume-to-volume prediction. Second and more important, the novel combination of residual connections (i.e., long and short) can greatly improve the training efficiency and discriminative capability of our network by enhancing the information propagation within the ConvNet both locally and globally. While the forward propagation of location information can improve the segmentation accuracy, the smooth backward propagation of gradient flow can accelerate the convergence speed and enhance the discrimination capability. Extensive experiments on the open MICCAI PROMISE12 challenge dataset corroborated the effectiveness of the proposed volumetric ConvNet with mixed residual connections. Our method ranked the first in the challenge, outperforming other competitors by a large margin with respect to most of evaluation metrics. The proposed volumetric ConvNet is general enough and can be easily extended to other medical image analysis tasks, especially ones with limited training data.",AAAI
Fine-Grained Recurrent Neural Networks for Automatic Prostate Segmentation in Ultrasound Images,2017,"Boundary incompleteness raises great challenges to automatic prostate segmentation in ultrasound images. Shape prior can provide strong guidance in estimating the missing boundary, but traditional shape models often suffer from hand-crafted descriptors and local information loss in the fitting procedure. In this paper, we attempt to address those issues with a novel framework. The proposed framework can seamlessly integrate feature extraction and shape prior exploring, and estimate the complete boundary with a sequential manner. Our framework is composed of three key modules. Firstly, we serialize the static 2D prostate ultrasound images into dynamic sequences and then predict prostate shapes by sequentially exploring shape priors. Intuitively, we propose to learn the shape prior with the biologically plausible Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). This module is corroborated to be effective in dealing with the boundary incompleteness. Secondly, to alleviate the bias caused by different serialization manners, we propose a multi-view fusion strategy to merge shape predictions obtained from different perspectives. Thirdly, we further implant the RNN core into a multiscale Auto-Context scheme to successively refine the details of the shape prediction map. With extensive validation on challenging prostate ultrasound images, our framework bridges severe boundary incompleteness and achieves the best performance in prostate boundary delineation when compared with several advanced methods. Additionally, our approach is general and can be extended to other medical image segmentation tasks, where boundary incompleteness is one of the main challenges.",AAAI
Online heterogeneous mixture modeling with marginal and copula selection,2011,"This paper proposes an online mixture modeling methodology in which individual components can have different marginal distributions and dependency structures. Mixture models have been widely studied and applied to various application areas, including density estimation, fraud/failure detection, image segmentation, etc. Previous research has been almost exclusively focused on mixture models having components of a single type (e.g., a Gaussian mixture model.) However, recent growing needs for complicated data modeling necessitate the use of more flexible mixture models (e.g., a mixture of a lognormal distribution for medical costs and a Gaussian distribution for blood pressure, for medical analytics.) Our key ideas include: 1) separating marginal distributions and their dependencies using copulas and 2) online extension of a recently-developed ""expectation minimization of description length,"" which enable us to efficiently learn types of both marginal distributions and copulas as well as their parameters. The proposed method provides not only good performance in applications, but also scalable, automatic model selection, which greatly reduces the intensive modeling costs in data mining processes. We show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in application to density estimation and to anomaly detection.",KDD
Modeling Physicians' Utterances to Explore Diagnostic Decision-making,2017,"Diagnostic error prevention is a long-established but specialized topic in clinical and psychological research. In this paper, we contribute to the field by exploring diagnostic decision-making via modeling physicians' utterances of medical concepts during image-based diagnoses. We conduct experiments to collect verbal narratives from dermatologists while they are examining and describing dermatology images towards diagnoses. We propose a hierarchical probabilistic framework to learn domain-specific patterns from the medical concepts in these narratives. The discovered patterns match the diagnostic units of thought identified by domain experts. These meaningful patterns uncover physicians' diagnostic decision-making processes while parsing the image content. Our evaluation shows that these patterns provide key information to classify narratives by diagnostic correctness levels.",IJCAI
DeepSD: Generating High Resolution Climate Change Projections through Single Image Super-Resolution,2017,"The impacts of climate change are felt by most critical systems, such as infrastructure, ecological systems, and power-plants. However, contemporary Earth System Models (ESM) are run at spatial resolutions too coarse for assessing effects this localized. Local scale projections can be obtained using statistical downscaling, a technique which uses historical climate observations to learn a low-resolution to high-resolution mapping. Depending on statistical modeling choices, downscaled projections have been shown to vary significantly terms of accuracy and reliability. The spatio-temporal nature of the climate system motivates the adaptation of super-resolution image processing techniques to statistical downscaling. In our work, we present DeepSD, a generalized stacked super resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN) framework for statistical downscaling of climate variables. DeepSD augments SRCNN with multi-scale input channels to maximize predictability in statistical downscaling. We provide a comparison with Bias Correction Spatial Disaggregation as well as three Automated-Statistical Downscaling approaches in downscaling daily precipitation from 1 degree (~100km) to 1/8 degrees (~12.5km) over the Continental United States. Furthermore, a framework using the NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) platform is discussed for downscaling more than 20 ESM models with multiple emission scenarios.",KDD
Exploiting Time-Series Image-to-Image Translation to Expand the Range of Wildlife Habitat Analysis,2019,"Characterizing wildlife habitat is one of the main topics in animal ecology. Locational data obtained from radio tracking and field observation are widely used in habitat analysis. However, such sampling methods are costly and laborious, and insufficient relocations often prevent scientists from conducting large-range and long-term research. In this paper, we innovatively exploit the image-to-image translation technology to expand the range of wildlife habitat analysis. We proposed a novel approach for implementing time-series imageto-image translation via metric embedding. A siamese neural network is used to learn the Euclidean temporal embedding from the image space. This embedding produces temporal vectors which bring time information into the adversarial network. The well-trained framework could effectively map the probabilistic habitat models from remote sensing imagery, helping scientists get rid of the persistent dependence on animal relocations. We illustrate our approach in a real-world application for mapping the habitats of Bar-headed Geese at Qinghai Lake breeding ground. We compare our model against several baselines and achieve promising results.",AAAI
Video-Based Person Re-Identification via Self Paced Weighting,2018,"Person re-identification (re-id) is a fundamental technique to associate various person images, captured by differentsurveillance cameras, to the same person. Compared to the single image based person re-id methods, video-based personre-id has attracted widespread attentions because extra space-time information and more appearance cues that can beused to greatly improve the matching performance. However, most existing video-based person re-id methods equally treatall video frames, ignoring their quality discrepancy caused by object occlusion and motions, which is a common phenomenonin real surveillance scenario. Based on this finding, we propose a novel video-based person re-id method via self paced weighting (SPW). Firstly, we propose a self paced outlier detection method to evaluate the noise degree of video sub sequences. Thereafter, a weighted multi-pair distance metric learning approach is adopted to measure the distance of two person image sequences. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over current state-of-the-art work.",AAAI
"SHIELD: Fast, Practical Defense and Vaccination for Deep Learning using JPEG Compression",2018,"The rapidly growing body of research in adversarial machine learning has demonstrated that deep neural networks (DNNs) are highly vulnerable to adversarially generated images. This underscores the urgent need for practical defense techniques that can be readily deployed to combat attacks in real-time. Observing that many attack strategies aim to perturb image pixels in ways that are visually imperceptible, we place JPEG compression at the core of our proposed SHIELD defense framework, utilizing its capability to effectively ""compress away"" such pixel manipulation. To immunize a DNN model from artifacts introduced by compression, SHIELD ""vaccinates"" the model by retraining it with compressed images, where different compression levels are applied to generate multiple vaccinated models that are ultimately used together in an ensemble defense. On top of that, SHIELD adds an additional layer of protection by employing randomization at test time that compresses different regions of an image using random compression levels, making it harder for an adversary to estimate the transformation performed. This novel combination of vaccination, ensembling, and randomization makes SHIELD a fortified multi-pronged defense. We conducted extensive, large-scale experiments using the ImageNet dataset, and show that our approaches eliminate up to 98% of gray-box attacks delivered by strong adversarial techniques such as Carlini-Wagner's L2 attack and DeepFool. Our approaches are fast and work without requiring knowledge about the model.",KDD
Hotels-50K: A Global Hotel Recognition Dataset,2019,"Recognizing a hotel from an image of a hotel room is important for human trafficking investigations. Images directly link victims to places and can help verify where victims have been trafficked, and where their traffickers might move them or others in the future. Recognizing the hotel from images is challenging because of low image quality, uncommon camera perspectives, large occlusions (often the victim), and the similarity of objects (e.g., furniture, art, bedding) across different hotel rooms. To support efforts towards this hotel recognition task, we have curated a dataset of over 1 million annotated hotel room images from 50,000 hotels. These images include professionally captured photographs from travel websites and crowd-sourced images from a mobile application, which are more similar to the types of images analyzed in real-world investigations. We present a baseline approach based on a standard network architecture and a collection of data-augmentation approaches tuned to this problem domain.",AAAI
Deep Adversarial Learning for Multi-Modality Missing Data Completion,2018,"Multi-modality data are widely used in clinical applications, such as tumor detection and brain disease diagnosis. Different modalities can usually provide complementary information, which commonly leads to improved performance. However, some modalities are commonly missing for some subjects due to various technical and practical reasons. As a result, multi-modality data are usually incomplete, raising the multi-modality missing data completion problem. In this work, we formulate the problem as a conditional image generation task and propose an encoder-decoder deep neural network to tackle this problem. Specifically, the model takes the existing modality as input and generates the missing modality. By employing an auxiliary adversarial loss, our model is able to generate high-quality missing modality images. At the same time, we propose to incorporate the available category information of subjects in training to enable the model to generate more informative images. We evaluate our method on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative~(ADNI) database, where positron emission tomography~(PET) modalities are missing. Experimental results show that the trained network can generate high-quality PET modalities based on existing magnetic resonance imaging~(MRI) modalities, and provide complementary information to improve the detection and tracking of the Alzheimer's disease. Our results also show that the proposed methods generate higher quality images than baseline methods as measured by various image quality statistics.",KDD
Difficulty-Aware Attention Network with Confidence Learning for Medical Image Segmentation,2019,"Medical image segmentation is a key step for various applications, such as image-guided radiation therapy and diagnosis. Recently, deep neural networks provided promising solutions for automatic image segmentation; however, they often perform good on regular samples (i.e., easy-to-segment samples), since the datasets are dominated by easy and regular samples. For medical images, due to huge inter-subject variations or disease-specific effects on subjects, there exist several difficult-to-segment cases that are often overlooked by the previous works. To address this challenge, we propose a difficulty-aware deep segmentation network with confidence learning for end-to-end segmentation. The proposed framework has two main contributions: 1) Besides the segmentation network, we also propose a fully convolutional adversarial network for confidence learning to provide voxel-wise and region-wise confidence information for the segmentation network. We relax the adversarial learning to confidence learning by decreasing the priority of adversarial learning, so that we can avoid the training imbalance between generator and discriminator. 2) We propose a difficulty-aware attention mechanism to properly handle hard samples or hard regions considering structural information, which may go beyond the shortcomings of focal loss. We further propose a fusion module to selectively fuse the concatenated feature maps in encoder-decoder architectures. Experimental results on clinical and challenge datasets show that our proposed network can achieve state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy. Further analysis also indicates that each individual component of our proposed network contributes to the overall performance improvement.",AAAI
Synergistic Image and Feature Adaptation: Towards Cross-Modality Domain Adaptation for Medical Image Segmentation,2019,"This paper presents a novel unsupervised domain adaptation framework, called Synergistic Image and Feature Adaptation (SIFA), to effectively tackle the problem of domain shift. Domain adaptation has become an important and hot topic in recent studies on deep learning, aiming to recover performance degradation when applying the neural networks to new testing domains. Our proposed SIFA is an elegant learning diagram which presents synergistic fusion of adaptations from both image and feature perspectives. In particular, we simultaneously transform the appearance of images across domains and enhance domain-invariance of the extracted features towards the segmentation task. The feature encoder layers are shared by both perspectives to grasp their mutual benefits during the end-to-end learning procedure. Without using any annotation from the target domain, the learning of our unified model is guided by adversarial losses, with multiple discriminators employed from various aspects. We have extensively validated our method with a challenging application of crossmodality medical image segmentation of cardiac structures. Experimental results demonstrate that our SIFA model recovers the degraded performance from 17.2% to 73.0%, and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.",AAAI
Simultaneous Feature and Sample Reduction for Image-Set Classification,2016,"Image-set classification is the assignment of a label to a given image set. In real-life scenarios such as surveillance videos, each image set often contains much redundancy in terms of features and samples. This paper introduces a joint learning method for image-set classification that simultaneously learns compact binary codes and removes redundant samples. The joint objective function of our model mainly includes two parts. The first part seeks a hashing function to generate binary codes that have larger inter-class and smaller intra-class distances. The second one reduces redundant samples with discrete constraints in a low-rank way. A kernel method based on anchor points is further used to reduce sample variations. The proposed discrete objective function is simplified to a series of sub-problems that admit an analytical solution, resulting in a high-quality discrete solution with a low computational cost. Experiments on three commonly used image-set datasets show that the proposed method for the tasks of face recognition from image sets is efficient and effective.",AAAI
Nostalgin: Extracting 3D City Models from Historical Image Data,2019,"What did it feel like to walk through a city from the past? In this work, we describe Nostalgin (Nostalgia Engine), a method that can faithfully reconstruct cities from historical images. Unlike existing work in city reconstruction, we focus on the task of reconstructing 3D cities from historical images. Working with historical image data is substantially more difficult, as there are significantly fewer buildings available and the details of the camera parameters which captured the images are unknown. Nostalgin can generate a city model even if there is only a single image per facade, regardless of viewpoint or occlusions. To achieve this, our novel architecture combines image segmentation, rectification, and inpainting. We motivate our design decisions with experimental analysis of individual components of our pipeline, and show that we can improve on baselines in both speed and visual realism. We demonstrate the efficacy of our pipeline by recreating two 1940s Manhattan city blocks. We aim to deploy Nostalgin as an open source platform where users can generate immersive historical experiences from their own photos.",KDD
Towards Domain Adaptive Vehicle Detection in Satellite Image by Supervised Super-Resolution Transfer,2016,"Vehicle detection in satellite image has attracted extensive research attentions with various emerging applications.However, the detector performance has been significantly degenerated due to the low resolutions of satellite images, as well as the limited training data.In this paper, a robust domain-adaptive vehicle detection framework is proposed to bypass both problems.Our innovation is to transfer the detector learning to the high-resolution aerial image domain,where rich supervision exists and robust detectors can be trained.To this end, we first propose a super-resolution algorithm using coupled dictionary learning to ``augment'' the satellite image region being tested into the aerial domain.Notably, linear detection loss is embedded into the dictionary learning, which enforces the augmented region to be sensitive to the subsequent detector training.Second, to cope with the domain changes, we propose an instance-wised detection using Exemplar Support Vector Machines (E-SVMs), which well handles the intra-class and imaging variations like scales, rotations, and occlusions.With comprehensive experiments on large-scale satellite image collections, we demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly boost the detection accuracy over several state-of-the-arts.",AAAI
Dual-Path in Dual-Path Network for Single Image Dehazing,2019,"Recently, deep learning-based single image dehazing method has been a popular approach to tackle dehazing. However, the existing dehazing approaches are performed directly on the original hazy image, which easily results in image blurring and noise amplifying. To address this issue, the paper proposes a DPDP-Net (Dual-Path in Dual-Path network) framework by employing a hierarchical dual path network. Specifically, the first-level dual-path network consists of a Dehazing Network and a Denoising Network, where the Dehazing Network is responsible for haze removal in the structural layer, and the Denoising Network deals with noise in the textural layer, respectively. And the second-level dual-path network lies in the Dehazing Network, which has an AL-Net (Atmospheric Light Network) and a TM-Net (Transmission Map Network), respectively. Concretely, the AL-Net aims to train the non-uniform atmospheric light, while the TM-Net aims to train the transmission map that reflects the visibility of the image. The final dehazing image is obtained by nonlinearly fusing the output of the Denoising Network and the Dehazing Network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DPDP-Net achieves competitive performance against the state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world images.",IJCAI
Information fusion based learning for frugal traffic state sensing,2013,"Traffic sensing is a key baseline input for sustainable cities to plan and administer demand-supply management through better road networks, public transportation, urban policies etc., Humans sense the environment frugally using a combination of complementary information signals from different sensors. For example, by viewing and/or hearing traffic one could identify the state of traffic on the road. In this paper, we demonstrate a fusion based learning approach to classify the traffic states using low cost audio and image data analysis using real world dataset. Road side collected traffic acoustic signals and traffic image snapshots obtained from fixed camera are used to classify the traffic condition into three broad classes viz., Jam, Medium and Free. The classification is done on f10 sec audio,image snapshot in that 10 sec g data tuple. We extract traffic relevant features from audio and image data to form a composite feature vector. In particular, we extract the audio features comprising MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) classifier based features, honk events and energy peaks. A simple heuristic based image classifier is used, where vehicular density and number of corner points within the road segment are estimated and are used as features for traffic sensing. Finally the composite vector is tested for its ability to discriminate the traffic classes using Decision tree classifier, SVM classifier, Discriminant classifier and Logistic regression based classifier. Information fusion at multiple levels (audio, image, overall) shows consistently better performance than individual level decision making. Low cost sensor fusion based on complementary weak classifiers and noisy features still generates high quality results with an overall accuracy of 93 - 96%.",IJCAI
Low-Cost Aerial Imaging For Small Holder Farmers,2019,"Recent work in networked systems has shown that using aerial imagery for farm monitoring can enable precision agriculture by lowering the cost and reducing the overhead of large scale sensor deployment. However, acquiring aerial imagery requires a drone, which has high capital and operational costs, often beyond the reach of farmers in the developing world. In this paper, we present TYE (Tethered eYE), an inexpensive platform for aerial imagery. It consists of a tethered helium balloon with a custom mount that can hold a smartphone (or a camera) with a battery pack. The balloon can be carried using a tether by a person or a vehicle. We incorporate various techniques to increase the operational time of the system, and to provide actionable insights even with unstable imagery. We develop path-planning algorithms and use that to develop an interactive mobile phone application that provides the user instant feedback to guide users to efficiently traverse large areas of land. We use computer vision algorithms to stitch orthomosaics by effectively countering wind-induced motion of the camera. We have used TYE for aerial imaging of agricultural land for over a year, and envision it as a low-cost aerial imaging platform for similar applications.",COMPASS
Friendship and mobility: user movement in location-based social networks,2011,"Even though human movement and mobility patterns have a high degree of freedom and variation, they also exhibit structural patterns due to geographic and social constraints. Using cell phone location data, as well as data from two online location-based social networks, we aim to understand what basic laws govern human motion and dynamics. We find that humans experience a combination of periodic movement that is geographically limited and seemingly random jumps correlated with their social networks. Short-ranged travel is periodic both spatially and temporally and not effected by the social network structure, while long-distance travel is more influenced by social network ties. We show that social relationships can explain about 10% to 30% of all human movement, while periodic behavior explains 50% to 70%. Based on our findings, we develop a model of human mobility that combines periodic short range movements with travel due to the social network structure. We show that our model reliably predicts the locations and dynamics of future human movement and gives an order of magnitude better performance than present models of human mobility.",KDD
Ambulatory Atrial Fibrillation Monitoring Using Wearable Photoplethysmography with Deep Learning,2019,"We develop an algorithm that accurately detects Atrial Fibrillation (AF) episodes from photoplethysmograms (PPG) recorded in ambulatory free-living conditions.

Using a 50-layer convolutional neural network, we achieve a test AUC of 95% in presence of motion artifacts inherent to PPG signals. Such continuous and accurate detection of AF has the potential to transform consumer wearable devices into clinically useful medical monitoring tools.",KDD
Crash to Not Crash: Learn to Identify Dangerous Vehicles Using a Simulator,2019,"Developing a computer vision-based algorithm for identifying dangerous vehicles requires a large amount of labeled accident data, which is difficult to collect in the real world. To tackle this challenge, we first develop a synthetic data generator built on top of a driving simulator. We then observe that the synthetic labels that are generated based on simulation results are very noisy, resulting in poor classification performance. In order to improve the quality of synthetic labels, we propose a new label adaptation technique that first extracts internal states of vehicles from the underlying driving simulator, and then refines labels by predicting future paths of vehicles based on a well-studied motion model. Via real-data experiments, we show that our dangerous vehicle classifier can reduce the missed detection rate by at least 18.5% compared with those trained with real data when time-to-collision is between 1.6s and 1.8s.",AAAI
Singapore in Motion: Insights on Public Transport Service Level Through Farecard and Mobile Data Analytics,2016,"Given the changing dynamics of mobility patterns and rapid growth of cities, transport agencies seek to respond more rapidly to needs of the public with the goal of offering an effective and competitive public transport system. A more data-centric approach for transport planning is part of the evolution of this process. In particular, the vast penetration of mobile phones provides an opportunity to monitor and derive insights on transport usage. Real time and historical analyses of such data can give a detailed understanding of mobility patterns of people and also suggest improvements to current transit systems. On its own, however, mobile geolocation data has a number of limitations. We thus propose a joint telco-and-farecard-based learning approach to understanding urban mobility. The approach enhances telecommunications data by leveraging it jointly with other sources of real-time data. The approach is illustrated on the First- and last-mile problem as well as route choice estimation within a densely-connected train network.",KDD
Towards long-lead forecasting of extreme flood events: a data mining framework for precipitation cluster precursors identification,2013,"The development of disastrous flood forecasting techniques able to provide warnings at a long lead-time (5-15 days) is of great importance to society. Extreme Flood is usually a consequence of a sequence of precipitation events occurring over from several days to several weeks. Though precise short-term forecasting the magnitude and extent of individual precipitation event is still beyond our reach, long-term forecasting of precipitation clusters can be attempted by identifying persistent atmospheric regimes that are conducive for the precipitation clusters. However, such forecasting will suffer from overwhelming number of relevant features and high imbalance of sample sets. In this paper, we propose an integrated data mining framework for identifying the precursors to precipitation event clusters and use this information to predict extended periods of extreme precipitation and subsequent floods. We synthesize a representative feature set that describes the atmosphere motion, and apply a streaming feature selection algorithm to online identify the precipitation precursors from the enormous feature space. A hierarchical re-sampling approach is embedded in the framework to deal with the imbalance problem. An extensive empirical study is conducted on historical precipitation and associated flood data collected in the State of Iowa. Utilizing our framework a few physically meaningful precipitation cluster precursor sets are identified from millions of features. More than 90% of extreme precipitation events are captured by the proposed prediction model using precipitation cluster precursors with a lead time of more than 5 days.",KDD
Modeling mass protest adoption in social network communities using geometric brownian motion,2014,"Modeling the movement of information within social media outlets, like Twitter, is key to understanding to how ideas spread but quantifying such movement runs into several difficulties. Two specific areas that elude a clear characterization are (i) the intrinsic random nature of individuals to potentially adopt and subsequently broadcast a Twitter topic, and (ii) the dissemination of information via non-Twitter sources, such as news outlets and word of mouth, and its impact on Twitter propagation. These distinct yet inter-connected areas must be incorporated to generate a comprehensive model of information diffusion. We propose a bispace model to capture propagation in the union of (exclusively) Twitter and non-Twitter environments. To quantify the stochastic nature of Twitter topic propagation, we combine principles of geometric Brownian motion and traditional network graph theory. We apply Poisson process functions to model information diffusion outside of the Twitter mentions network. We discuss techniques to unify the two sub-models to accurately model information dissemination. We demonstrate the novel application of these techniques on real Twitter datasets related to mass protest adoption in social communities.",KDD
Learning Sparse Kernels from 3D Surfaces for Heart Wall Motion Abnormality Detection,2008,"Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a global epidemic that is the leading cause of death worldwide. CHD can be detected by measuring and scoring the regional and global motion of the left ventricle (LV) of the heart. This project describes a novel automatic technique which can detect the regional wall motion abnormalities of the LV from echocardiograms. Given a sequence of endocardial contours extracted from LV ultrasound images, the sequence of contoursmoving through time can be interpreted as a three-dimensional (3D) surface. From the 3D surfaces, we compute several geometry-based features (shape-index values, curvedness, surface normals, etc.) to obtain histograms-based similarity functions that are optimally combined using a mathematical programming approach to learn a kernel function designed to classify normal vs. abnormal heart wall motion. In contrast with other state-of-the-art methods, our formulation also generates sparse kernels. Kernel sparsity is directly related to the computational cost of the kernel evaluation, which is an important factor when designing classifiers that are part of a real-time system. Experimental results on a set of echocardiograms collected in routine clinical practice at one hospital demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach",AAAI
Rotation-blended CNNs on a New Open Dataset for Tropical Cyclone Image-to-intensity Regression,2018,"Tropical cyclone (TC) is a type of severe weather systems that occur in tropical regions. Accurate estimation of TC intensity is crucial for disaster management. Moreover, the intensity estimation task is the key to understand and forecast the behavior of TCs better. Recently, the task has begun to attract attention from not only meteorologists but also data scientists. Nevertheless, it is hard to stimulate joint research between both types of scholars without a benchmark dataset to work on together. In this work, we release a such a benchmark dataset, which is a new open dataset collected from satellite remote sensing, for the TC-image-to-intensity estimation task. We also propose a novel model to solve this task based on the convolutional neural network (CNN). We discover that the usual CNN, which is mature for object recognition, requires several modifications when being used for the intensity estimation task. Furthermore, we combine the domain knowledge of meteorologists, such as the rotation-invariance of TCs, into our model design to reach better performance. Experimental results on the released benchmark dataset verify that the proposed model is among the most accurate models that can be used for TC intensity estimation, while being relatively more stable across all situations. The results demonstrate the potential of applying data science for meteorology study.",KDD
AirSim-W: A Simulation Environment for Wildlife Conservation with UAVs,2018,"Increases in poaching levels have led to the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones) to count animals, locate animals in parks, and even find poachers. Finding poachers is often done at night through the use of long wave thermal infrared cameras mounted on these UAVs. Unfortunately, monitoring the live video stream from the conservation UAVs all night is an arduous task. In order to assist in this monitoring task, new techniques in computer vision have been developed. This work is based on a dataset which took approximately six months to label. However, further improvement in detection and future testing of autonomous flight require not only more labeled training data, but also an environment where algorithms can be safely tested. In order to meet both goals efficiently, we present AirSim-W, a simulation environment that has been designed specifically for the domain of wildlife conservation. This includes (i) creation of an African savanna environment in Unreal Engine, (ii) integration of a new thermal infrared model based on radiometry, (iii) API code expansions to follow objects of interest or fly in zig-zag patterns to generate simulated training data, and (iv) demonstrated detection improvement using simulated data generated by AirSim-W. With these additional simulation features, AirSim-W will be directly useful for wildlife conservation research.",COMPASS
Discriminative Semi-Coupled Projective Dictionary Learning for Low-Resolution Person Re-Identification,2018,"Person re-identification (re-ID) is a fundamental task in automated video surveillance. In real-world visual surveillance systems, a person is often captured in quite low resolutions. So we often need to perform low-resolution person re-ID, where images captured by different cameras have great resolution divergences. Existing methods cope problem via some complicated and time-consuming strategies, making them less favorable in practice, and their performances are far from satisfactory. In this paper, we design a novel Discriminative Semi-coupled Projective Dictionary Learning (DSPDL) model to effectively and efficiently solve this problem. Specifically, we propose to jointly learn a pair of dictionaries and a mapping to bridge the gap across low(er) and high(er) resolution person images. Besides, we develop a novel graph regularizer to incorporate positive and negative image pair information in a parameterless fashion. Meanwhile, we adopt the efficient and powerful projective dictionary learning technique to boost the our efficiency. Experiments on three public datasets show the superiority of the proposed method to the state-of-the-art ones.",AAAI
Scale-adaptive Low-resolution Person Re-identification via Learning A Discriminating Surface,2016,"Person re-identification, as an important task in video surveillance and forensics applications, has been widely studied. But most of previous approaches are based on the key assumption that images for comparison have the same resolution and a uniform scale. Some recent works investigate how to match low resolution query images against high resolution gallery images, but still assume that the low-resolution query images have the same scale. In real scenarios, person images may not only be with low-resolution but also have different scales. Through investigating the distance variation behavior by changing image scales, we observe that scale-distance functions, generated by image pairs under different scales from the same person or different persons, are distinguishable and can be classified as feasible (for a pair of images from the same person) or infeasible (for a pair of images from different persons). The scale-distance functions are further represented by parameter vectors in the scale-distance function space. On this basis, we propose to learn a discriminating surface separating these feasible and infeasible functions in the scale-distance function space, and use it for reidentifying persons. Experimental results on two simulated datasets and one public dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",IJCAI
Real-time Traffic Pattern Analysis and Inference with Sparse Video Surveillance Information,2018,"Recent advances inÃ video surveillance systems enable a new paradigm for intelligent urban traffic management systems. Since surveillance cameras are usually sparsely located to cover key regions of the road under surveillance, it is a big challenge to perform a complete real-time traffic pattern analysis based on incomplete sparse surveillance information. As a result, existing works mostly focus on predicting traffic volumes with historical records available at a particular locationÃ and may not provide a complete picture of real-time traffic patterns. To this end, in this paper, we go beyond existing works and tackle the challenges of traffic flow analysis from three perspectives. First, we train the transition probabilities to capture vehicles' movement patterns. The transition probabilities are trained from third-party vehicle GPS data, and thus can work in the area even if there is no camera. Second, we exploit the Multivariate Normal Distribution model together with the transferred probabilities to estimate the unobserved traffic patterns. Third, we propose an algorithm for real-time traffic inference withÃ surveillance as a complement source of information. Finally, experiments on real-world data show the effectiveness of our approach.",IJCAI
On Organizing Online Soirees with Live Multi-Streaming,2018,"The popularity of live streaming has led to the explosive growth in new video contents and social communities on emerging platforms such as Facebook Live and Twitch. Viewers on these platforms are able to follow multiple streams of live events simultaneously, while engaging discussions with friends. However, existing approaches for selecting live streaming channels still focus on satisfying individual preferences of users, without considering the need to accommodate real-time social interactions among viewers and to diversify the content of streams. In this paper, therefore, we formulate a new Social-aware Diverse and Preferred Live Streaming Channel Query (SDSQ) that jointly selects a set of diverse and preferred live streaming channels and a group of socially tight viewers. We prove that SDSQ is NP-hard and inapproximable within any factor, and design SDSSel, a 2-approximation algorithm with a guaranteed error bound. We perform a user study on Twitch with 432 participants to validate the need of SDSQ and the usefulness of SDSSel. We also conduct large-scale experiments on real datasets to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over several baselines in terms of solution quality and efficiency.",AAAI
Inferring Concept Prerequisite Relations from Online Educational Resources,2019,"The Internet has rich and rapidly increasing sources of high quality educational content. Inferring prerequisite relations between educational concepts is required for modern large-scale online educational technology applications such as personalized recommendations and automatic curriculum creation. We present PREREQ, a new supervised learning method for inferring concept prerequisite relations. PREREQ is designed using latent representations of concepts obtained from the Pairwise Latent Dirichlet Allocation model, and a neural network based on the Siamese network architecture. PREREQ can learn unknown concept prerequisites from course prerequisites and labeled concept prerequisite data. It outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark datasets and can effectively learn from very less training data. PREREQ can also use unlabeled video playlists, a steadily growing source of training data, to learn concept prerequisites, thus obviating the need for manual annotation of course prerequisites.",AAAI
Affect-Aware Student Models for Robot Tutors (Page 864),2016,"Computational tutoring systems, such as educational software or interactive robots, have the potential for great societal benefit. Such systems track and assess students' knowledge via inferential methods, such as the popular Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) algorithm. However, these methods do not typically draw on the affective signals that human teachers use to assess knowledge, such as indications of discomfort, engagement, or frustration. In this paper we present a novel extension to the BKT model that uses affective data, derived autonomously from video records of children playing an interactive story-telling game with a robot, to infer student knowledge of reading skills. We find that, compared to a control group of children who played the game with only a tablet, children who interacted with an embodied social robot generated stronger affective data signals of engagement and enjoyment during the interaction. We then show that incorporating this affective data into model training improves the quality of the learned knowledge inference models. These results suggest that physically embodied, affect-aware robot tutors can provide more effective and empathic educational experiences for children, and advance both algorithmic and human-centered motivations for further development of systems that tightly integrate affect understanding and complex models of inference with interactive, educational robots.",AAMAS
DeepUrbanEvent: A System for Predicting Citywide Crowd Dynamics at Big Events,2019,"Event crowd management has been a significant research topic with high social impact. When some big events happen such as an earthquake, typhoon, and national festival, crowd management becomes the first priority for governments (e.g. police) and public service operators (e.g. subway/bus operator) to protect people's safety or maintain the operation of public infrastructures. However, under such event situations, human behavior will become very different from daily routines, which makes prediction of crowd dynamics at big events become highly challenging, especially at a citywide level. Therefore in this study, we aim to extract the deep trend only from the current momentary observations and generate an accurate prediction for the trend in the short future, which is considered to be an effective way to deal with the event situations. Motivated by these, we build an online system called DeepUrbanEvent which can iteratively take citywide crowd dynamics from the current one hour as input and report the prediction results for the next one hour as output. A novel deep learning architecture built with recurrent neural networks is designed to effectively model these highly-complex sequential data in an analogous manner to video prediction tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed methodology to the existing approaches. Lastly, we apply our prototype system to multiple big real-world events and show that it is highly deployable as an online crowd management system.",KDD
Cellular Network Traffic Scheduling with Deep Reinforcement Learning,2018,"Modern mobile networks are facing unprecedented growth in demand due to a new class of traffic from Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as smart wearables and autonomous cars. Future networks must schedule delay-tolerant software updates, data backup, and other transfers from IoT devices while maintaining strict service guarantees for conventional real-time applications such as voice-calling and video. This problem is extremely challenging because conventional traffic is highly dynamic across space and time, so its performance is significantly impacted if all IoT traffic is scheduled immediately when it originates. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning (RL) based scheduler that can dynamically adapt to traffic variation, and to various reward functions set by network operators, to optimally schedule IoT traffic. Using 4 weeks of real network data from downtown Melbourne, Australia spanning diverse traffic patterns, we demonstrate that our RL scheduler can enable mobile networks to carry 14.7% more data with minimal impact on existing traffic, and outpeforms heuristic schedulers by more than 2x. Our work is a valuable step towards designing autonomous, ""self-driving"" networks that learn to manage themselves from past data.",AAAI
Who are experts specializing in landscape photography?: analyzing topic-specific authority on content sharing services,2014,"With the rapid growth of Web 2.0, a variety of content sharing services, such as Flickr, YouTube, Blogger, and TripAdvisor etc, have become extremely popular over the last decade. On these websites, users have created and shared with each other various kinds of resources, such as photos, video, and travel blogs. The sheer amount of user-generated content varies greatly in quality, which calls for a principled method to identify a set of authorities, who created high-quality resources, from a massive number of contributors of content. Since most previous studies only infer global authoritativeness of a user, there is no way to differentiate the authoritativeness in different aspects of life (topics).
 In this paper, we propose a novel model of Topic-specific Authority Analysis (TAA), which addresses the limitations of the previous approaches, to identify authorities specific to given query topic(s) on a content sharing service. This model jointly leverages the usage data collected from the sharing log and the favorite log. The parameters in TAA are learned from a constructed training dataset, for which a novel logistic likelihood function is specifically designed. To perform Bayesian inference for TAA with the new logistic likelihood, we extend typical Gibbs sampling by introducing auxiliary variables. Thorough experiments with two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TAA in topic-specific authority identification as well as the generalizability of the TAA generative model.",KDD
Sequence Multi-task Learning to Forecast Mental Wellbeing from Sparse Self-reported Data,2019,"Smartphones have started to be used as self reporting tools for mental health state as they accompany individuals during their days and can therefore gather temporally fine grained data. However, the analysis of self reported mood data offers challenges related to non-homogeneity of mood assessment among individuals due to the complexity of the feeling and the reporting scales, as well as the noise and sparseness of the reports when collected in the wild. In this paper, we propose a new end-to-end ML model inspired by video frame prediction and machine translation, that forecasts future sequences of mood from previous self-reported moods collected in the real world using mobile devices. Contrary to traditional time series forecasting algorithms, our multi-task encoder-decoder recurrent neural network learns patterns from different users, allowing and improving the prediction for users with limited number of self-reports. Unlike traditional feature-based machine learning algorithms, the encoder-decoder architecture enables to forecast a sequence of future moods rather than one single step. Meanwhile, multi-task learning exploits some unique characteristics of the data (mood is bi-dimensional), achieving better results than when training single-task networks or other classifiers.
 Our experiments using a real-world dataset of 33,000 user-weeks revealed that (i) 3 weeks of sparsely reported mood is the optimal number to accurately forecast mood, (ii) multi-task learning models both dimensions of mood ""valence and arousal"" with higher accuracy than separate or traditional ML models, and (iii) mood variability, personality traits and day of the week play a key role in the performance of our model. We believe this work provides psychologists and developers of future mobile mental health applications with a ready-to-use and effective tool for early diagnosis of mental health issues at scale.",KDD
Learning Behavior Patterns from Video: A Data-Driven Framework for Agent-based Crowd Modeling (Page 801),2015,"This paper proposes a generic data-driven crowd modeling framework to generate crowd behaviors that can match the video data. The proposed framework uses a dual-layer mechanism to model the crowd behaviors. The bottom layer models the microscopic collision avoidance behaviors, while the top layer models the macroscopic crowd behaviors such as the goal selection patterns and the path navigation patterns. Based on the dual-layer mechanism, an automatic learning method is proposed to learn the model components from video data. To validate its effectiveness, the proposed framework is applied to generate the crowd behaviors in New York Grand Central Terminal. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to construct effective model that can generate the desired emergent crowd behaviors and can offer promising prediction performance.",AAMAS
A pattern discovery approach to retail fraud detection,2011,"A major source of revenue shrink in retail stores is the intentional or unintentional failure of proper checking out of items by the cashier. More recently, a few automated surveillance systems have been developed to monitor cashier lanes and detect non-compliant activities such as fake item checkouts or scans done with the intention of deriving monetary benefit. These systems use data from surveillance video cameras and transaction logs (TLog) recorded at the Point-of-Sale (POS). In this paper, we present a pattern discovery based approach to detect fraudulent events at the POS. Our approach is based on mining time-ordered text streams, representing retail transactions, formed from a combination of visually detected checkout related activities called primitives and barcodes from TLog data. Patterns representing single item checkouts, i.e. anchored around a single barcode, are discovered from these text streams using an efficient pattern discovery technique called Teiresias. The discovered patterns are used to build models for true and fake item scans by retaining or discarding the anchoring barcodes in those patterns respectively. A pattern matching and classification scheme is designed to robustly detect non-compliant cashier activities in the presence of noise in either the TLog or the video data. Different weighting schemes for quantifying the relative importance of the discovered patterns are explored: Frequency, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Frequency+SVM. Using a large scale dataset recorded from retail stores, our approach discovers semantically meaningful cashier scan patterns. Our experiments also suggest that different weighting schemes result in varied false and true positive performances on the task of fake scan detection.",KDD
StepDeep: A Novel Spatial-temporal Mobility Event Prediction Framework based on Deep Neural Network,2018,"A mobility event occurs when a passenger moves out or takes off from a particular location. Mobility event prediction is of utmost importance in the field of intelligent transportation systems. It has a huge potential in solving important problems such as minimizing passenger waiting time and maximizing the utilization of the transportation resources by planning vehicle routes and dispatching transportation resources. Recently, numerous mobility pattern mining methods have been proposed to predict the transportation supply and demand in different locations. Those methods first reveal the event patterns of each Place of Interests (POI) independently and then employ a separate region function as a post-processing step. This separate process, that disregards the intrinsic spatial and temporal pattern correlations between POI, is sub-optimal and complex, resulting in a poor generalization in different scenarios. In this work, we propose a Spatial-Temporal mobility Event Prediction framework based on Deep neural network (StepDeep) for simultaneously taking into account all correlated spatial and temporal mobility patterns. StepDeep not only simplifies the prediction process but also enhances the prediction accuracy. Our StepDeep proposes a novel problem formulation towards an end-to-end mobility prediction framework, that is, switching mobility events over time in an area into an event video and then posing the mobility prediction problem as a video prediction task. Such a novel formulation can naturally encode spatial and temporal dependencies for each POI. StepDeep thus predicts the spatial-temporal events by incorporating the new time sensitive convolution filters, spatial sensitive convolution filters, and spatial-temporal sensitive convolution filters into a single network. We conduct experimental evaluations on a real-world 547-day New York City taxi trajectory dataset, which show that StepDeep provides higher prediction accuracy than five existing baselines. Moreover, StepDeep is generalizable and can be applied to numerous spatial-temporal event prediction scenarios.",KDD
"Finding ""Unexplained"" Activities in Video",2011,"Consider a video surveillance application that monitors some location. The application knows a set of activity models (that are either normal or abnormal or both), but in addition, the application wants to find video segments that are unexplained by any of the known activity models Ã¢â¬â these unexplained video segments may correspond to activities for which no previous activity model existed. In this paper, we formally define what it means for a given video segment to be unexplained (totally or partially) w.r.t. a given set of activity models and a probability threshold. We develop two algorithms Ã¢â¬â FindTUA and FindPUA Ã¢â¬â to identify Totally and Partially Unexplained Activities respectively, and show that both algorithms use important pruning methods. We report on experiments with a prototype implementation showing that the algorithms both run efficiently and are accurate.",IJCAI
Detecting the Moment of Snap in Real-World Football Videos,2013,"In recent years, there has been a great increase in the use of web services for the storage, annotation, and sharing of sports video by athletic teams. Most of these web services, however, do not provide enhanced functional- ities to their users that would enable, e.g., faster access to certain video moments, or reduce manual labor in video annotation. One such web service specializes in American football videos, supporting over 13,000 high school and college teams. Its users often need to fast- forward the video to certain moments of snap when the corresponding plays of the football game start. To our knowledge, this paper describes the first effort toward automating this enhanced functionality. Under a very tight running-time budget, our approach reliably detects the start of a play in an arbitrary football video with minimal assumptions about the scene, viewpoint, video resolution and shot quality. We face many challenges that are rarely addressed by a typical computer vision system, such as, e.g., a wide range of camera viewing angles and distances, and poor resolution and lighting conditions. Extensive empirical evaluation shows that our approach is very close to being usable in a real- world setting.",AAAI
Time-varying learning and content analytics via sparse factor analysis,2014,"We propose SPARFA-Trace, a new machine learning-based framework for time-varying learning and content analytics for educational applications. We develop a novel message passing-based, blind, approximate Kalman filter for sparse factor analysis (SPARFA) that jointly traces learner concept knowledge over time, analyzes learner concept knowledge state transitions (induced by interacting with learning resources, such as textbook sections, lecture videos, etc., or the forgetting effect), and estimates the content organization and difficulty of the questions in assessments. These quantities are estimated solely from binary-valued (correct/incorrect) graded learner response data and the specific actions each learner performs (e.g., answering a question or studying a learning resource) at each time instant. Experimental results on two online course datasets demonstrate that SPARFA-Trace is capable of tracing each learner's concept knowledge evolution over time, analyzing the quality and content organization of learning resources, and estimating the question--concept associations and the question difficulties. Moreover, we show that SPARFA-Trace achieves comparable or better performance in predicting unobserved learner responses compared to existing collaborative filtering and knowledge tracing methods.",KDD
Modeling Dwell Time Engagement on Visual Multimedia,2019,"Visual multimedia is one of the most prevalent sources of modern online content and engagement. However, despite its prevalence, little is known about user engagement with such content. For instance, how can we model engagement for a specific content or viewer sample, and across multiple samples? Can we model and discover patterns in these interactions, and detect outlying behaviors corresponding to abnormal engagement? In this paper, we study these questions in depth. Understanding these questions has implications in user modeling and understanding, ranking, trust and safety and more. For analysis, we consider content and viewer dwell time (engagement duration) behaviors with images and videos on Snapchat Stories, one of the largest multimedia-driven social sharing services. To our knowledge, we are the first to model and analyze dwell time behaviors on such media. Specifically, our contributions include (a) individual modeling: we propose and evaluate the ÃÂFmodel, ÃÂTmodel and \Vmodel parametric models to describe dwell times of unlooped/looped media and viewers which outperform alternatives, (b) aggregate modeling: we show how to flexibly summarize the respective joint distributions of multivariate parametrized fits across many samples using Vine Copulas in the analog \ALFmodel, \ALTmodel and \AVmodel models, which enable inferences regarding aggregate behavioral patterns, and offer the ability to simulate real-looking engagement data (c) anomaly detection: we demonstrate our aggregate models can robustly detect anomalies present during training ($0.9+$ AUROC across most attack models), and also enable discovery of real dwell time anomalies.",KDD
A Sparse Combined Regression-Classification Formulation for Learning a Physiological Alternative to Clinical Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Scores,2015,"Current diagnostic methods for mental pathologies, including Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), involve a clinician-coded interview, which can be subjective. Heart rate and skin conductance, as well as other peripheral physiology measures, have previously shown utility in predicting binary diagnostic decisions. The binary decision problem is easier, but misses important information on the severity of the patientÃ¢â¬â¢s condition. This work utilizes a novel experimental set-up that exploits virtual reality videos and peripheral physiology for PTSD diagnosis. In pursuit of an automated physiology-based objective diagnostic method, we propose a learning formulation that integrates the description of the experimental data and expert knowledge on desirable properties of a physiological diagnostic score. From a list of desired criteria, we derive a new cost function that combines regression and classification while learning the salient features for predicting physiological score. The physiological score produced by Sparse Combined Regression-Classification (SCRC) is assessed with respect to three sets of criteria chosen to reflect design goals for an objective, physiological PTSD score: parsimony and context of selected features, diagnostic score validity, and learning generalizability. For these criteria, we demonstrate that Sparse Combined Regression-Classification performs better than more generic learning approaches.",AAAI
HireNet: A Hierarchical Attention Model for the Automatic Analysis of Asynchronous Video Job Interviews,2019,"New technologies drastically change recruitment techniques. Some research projects aim at designing interactive systems that help candidates practice job interviews. Other studies aim at the automatic detection of social signals (e.g. smile, turn of speech, etc...) in videos of job interviews. These studies are limited with respect to the number of interviews they process, but also by the fact that they only analyze simulated job interviews (e.g. students pretending to apply for a fake position). Asynchronous video interviewing tools have become mature products on the human resources market, and thus, a popular step in the recruitment process. As part of a project to help recruiters, we collected a corpus of more than 7000 candidates having asynchronous video job interviews for real positions and recording videos of themselves answering a set of questions. We propose a new hierarchical attention model called HireNet that aims at predicting the hirability of the candidates as evaluated by recruiters. In HireNet, an interview is considered as a sequence of questions and answers containing salient socials signals. Two contextual sources of information are modeled in HireNet: the words contained in the question and in the job position. Our model achieves better F1-scores than previous approaches for each modality (verbal content, audio and video). Results from early and late multimodal fusion suggest that more sophisticated fusion schemes are needed to improve on the monomodal results. Finally, some examples of moments captured by the attention mechanisms suggest our model could potentially be used to help finding key moments in an asynchronous job interview.",AAAI
Early Detection of Vacant Parking Spaces Using Dashcam Videos,2019,"A major problem in metropolitan areas is finding parking spaces. Existing parking guidance systems often adopt fixed sensors or cameras that cannot provide information from the driverÃ¢â¬â¢s point of view. Motivated by the advent of dashboard cameras (dashcams), we develop neural-network-based methods for detecting vacant parking spaces in videos recorded by a dashcam. Detecting vacant parking spaces in dashcam videos enables early detection of spaces. Different from conventional object detection methods, we leverage the monotonicity of the detection confidence with respect to the distance away of the approaching target parking space and propose a new loss function, which can not only yield improved detection results but also enable early detection. To evaluate our detection method, we create a new large dataset containing 5,800 dashcam videos captured from 22 indoor and outdoor parking lots. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and largest driverÃ¢â¬â¢s view video dataset that supports parking space detection and provides parking space occupancy annotations.",AAAI
Intrusion as (anti)social communication: characterization and detection,2012,"A reasonable definition of intrusion is: entering a community to which one does not belong. This suggests that in a network, intrusion attempts may be detected by looking for communication that does not respect community boundaries. In this paper, we examine the utility of this concept for identifying malicious network sources. In particular, our goal is to explore whether this concept allows a core-network operator using flow data to augment signature-based systems located at network edges. We show that simple measures of communities can be defined for flow data that allow a remarkably effective level of intrusion detection simply by looking for flows that do not respect those communities. We validate our approach using labeled intrusion attempt data collected at a large number of edge networks. Our results suggest that community-based methods can offer an important additional dimension for intrusion detection systems.",KDD
LARC: Learning Activity-Regularized Overlapping Communities Across Time,2018,"Communities are essential building blocks of complex networks enjoying significant research attention in terms of modeling and detection algorithms. Common across models is the premise that node pairs that share communities are likely to interact more strongly. Moreover, in the most general setting a node may be a member of multiple communities, and thus, interact with more than one cohesive group of other nodes. If node interactions are observed over a long period and aggregated into a single static network, the communities may be hard to discern due to their in-network overlap. Alternatively, if interactions are observed over short time periods, the communities may be only partially observable. How can we detect communities at an appropriate temporal resolution that resonates with their natural periods of activity? We propose LARC, a general framework for joint learning of the overlapping community structure and the periods of activity of communities, directly from temporal interaction data. We formulate the problem as an optimization task coupling community fit and smooth temporal activation over time. To the best of our knowledge, the tensor version of LARC is the first tensor-based community detection method to introduce such smoothness constraints. We propose efficient algorithms for the problem, achieving a $2.6x$ quality improvement over all baselines for high temporal resolution datasets, and consistently detecting better-quality communities for different levels of data aggregation and varying community overlap. In addition, LARC elucidates interpretable temporal patterns of community activity corresponding to botnet attacks, transportation change points and public forum interaction trends, while being computationally practical---few minutes on large real datasets. Finally, LARC provides a comprehensive \em unsupervised parameter estimation methodology yielding high accuracy and rendering it easy-to-use for practitioners.",KDD
Probabilistic latent network visualization: inferring and embedding diffusion networks,2014,"The diffusion of information, rumors, and diseases are assumed to be probabilistic processes over some network structure. An event starts at one node of the network, and then spreads to the edges of the network. In most cases, the underlying network structure that generates the diffusion process is unobserved, and we only observe the times at which each node is altered/influenced by the process. This paper proposes a probabilistic model for inferring the diffusion network, which we call Probabilistic Latent Network Visualization (PLNV); it is based on cascade data, a record of observed times of node influence. An important characteristic of our approach is to infer the network by embedding it into a low-dimensional visualization space. We assume that each node in the network has latent coordinates in the visualization space, and diffusion is more likely to occur between nodes that are placed close together. Our model uses maximum a posteriori estimation to learn the latent coordinates of nodes that best explain the observed cascade data. The latent coordinates of nodes in the visualization space can 1) enable the system to suggest network layouts most suitable for browsing, and 2) lead to high accuracy in inferring the underlying network when analyzing the diffusion process of new or rare information, rumors, and disease.",KDD
Inferring networks of diffusion and influence,2010,"Information diffusion and virus propagation are fundamental processes talking place in networks. While it is often possible to directly observe when nodes become infected, observing individual transmissions (i.e., who infects whom or who influences whom) is typically very difficult. Furthermore, in many applications, the underlying network over which the diffusions and propagations spread is actually unobserved. We tackle these challenges by developing a method for tracing paths of diffusion and influence through networks and inferring the networks over which contagions propagate. Given the times when nodes adopt pieces of information or become infected, we identify the optimal network that best explains the observed infection times. Since the optimization problem is NP-hard to solve exactly, we develop an efficient approximation algorithm that scales to large datasets and in practice gives provably near-optimal performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by tracing information cascades in a set of 170 million blogs and news articles over a one year period to infer how information flows through the online media space. We find that the diffusion network of news tends to have a core-periphery structure with a small set of core media sites that diffuse information to the rest of the Web. These sites tend to have stable circles of influence with more general news media sites acting as connectors between them.",KDD
Investigate Transitions into Drug Addiction through Text Mining of Reddit Data,2019,"Increasing rates of opioid drug abuse and heightened prevalence of online support communities underscore the necessity of employing data mining techniques to better understand drug addiction using these rapidly developing online resources. In this work, we obtained data from Reddit, an online collection of forums, to gather insight into drug use/misuse using text snippets from users narratives. Specifically, using users' posts, we trained a binary classifier which predicts a user's transitions from casual drug discussion forums to drug recovery forums. We also proposed a Cox regression model that outputs likelihoods of such transitions. In doing so, we found that utterances of select drugs and certain linguistic features contained in one's posts can help predict these transitions. Using unfiltered drug-related posts, our research delineates drugs that are associated with higher rates of transitions from recreational drug discussion to support/recovery discussion, offers insight into modern drug culture, and provides tools with potential applications in combating the opioid crisis.",KDD
Experience from hosting a corporate prediction market: benefits beyond the forecasts,2013,"Prediction markets are virtual stock markets used to gain insight and forecast events by leveraging the wisdom of crowds. Popularly applied in the public to cultural questions (election results, box-office returns), they have recently been applied by corporations to leverage employee knowledge and forecast answers to business questions (sales volumes, products and features, release timing). Determining whether to run a prediction market requires practical experience that is rarely described.
 Over the last few years, Ford Motor Company obtained practical experience by deploying one of the largest corporate prediction markets known. Business partners in the US, Europe, and South America provided questions on new vehicle features, sales volumes, take rates, pricing, and macroeconomic trends.
 We describe our experience, including both the strong and weak correlations found between predictions and real world results. Evaluating this methodology goes beyond prediction accuracy, however, since there are many side benefits. In addition to the predictions, we discuss the value of comments, stock price changes over time, the ability to overcome bureaucratic limits, and flexibly filling holes in corporate knowledge, enabling better decision making. We conclude with advice on running prediction markets, including writing good questions, market duration, motivating traders and protecting confidential information.",KDD
Deep Hierarchical Graph Convolution for Election Prediction from Geospatial Census Data,2019,"Geographic information systemsÃ¢â¬â¢ (GIS) research is widely used within the social and physical sciences and plays a crucial role in the development and implementation by governments of economic, education, environment and transportation policy. While machine learning methods have been applied to GIS datasets, the uptake of powerful deep learning CNN methodologies has been limited in part due to challenges posed by the complex and often poorly structured nature of the data. In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of GCNNs for GIS analysis via a multi-graph hierarchical spatial-filter GCNN network model in the context of GIS systems to predict election outcomes using socio-economic features drawn from the 2016 Australian Census. We report a marked improvement in performance accuracy of Hierarchical GCNNs over benchmark generalised linear models and standard GCNNs, especially in semi-supervised tasks. These results indicate the widespread potential for GIS-GCNN research methods to enrich socio-economic GIS analysis, aiding the social sciences and policy development.",AAAI
Swissnoise: Online Polls with Game-Theoretic Incentives,2014,"There is much interest in crowdsourcing information that is distributed among many individuals, such as the likelihood of future events, election outcomes, the quality of products, or the consequence of a decision. To obtain accurate outcomes, various game-theoretic incentive schemes have been proposed. However, only prediction markets have been tried in practice. In this paper, we describe an experimental platform, swissnoise, that compares prediction markets with peer prediction schemes developed in recent AI research. It shows that peer prediction schemes can achieve similar performance while being applicable to a much broader range of questions.",AAAI

Assessing Candidate Preference through Web Browsing History,2018,"Predicting election outcomes is of considerable interest to candidates, political scientists, and the public at large. We propose the use of Web browsing history as a new indicator of candidate preference among the electorate, one that has potential to overcome a number of the drawbacks of election polls. However, there are a number of challenges that must be overcome to effectively use Web browsing for assessing candidate preference - including the lack of suitable ground truth data and the heterogeneity of user populations in time and space. We address these challenges, and show that the resulting methods can shed considerable light on the dynamics of voters' candidate preferences in ways that are difficult to achieve using polls.",KDD
Relational learning via latent social dimensions,2009,"Social media such as blogs, Facebook, Flickr, etc., presents data in a network format rather than classical IID distribution. To address the interdependency among data instances, relational learning has been proposed, and collective inference based on network connectivity is adopted for prediction. However, connections in social media are often multi-dimensional. An actor can connect to another actor for different reasons, e.g., alumni, colleagues, living in the same city, sharing similar interests, etc. Collective inference normally does not differentiate these connections. In this work, we propose to extract latent social dimensions based on network information, and then utilize them as features for discriminative learning. These social dimensions describe diverse affiliations of actors hidden in the network, and the discriminative learning can automatically determine which affiliations are better aligned with the class labels. Such a scheme is preferred when multiple diverse relations are associated with the same network. We conduct extensive experiments on social media data (one from a real-world blog site and the other from a popular content sharing site). Our model outperforms representative relational learning methods based on collective inference, especially when few labeled data are available. The sensitivity of this model and its connection to existing methods are also examined.",KDD
"Beyond Sigmoids: The NetTide Model for Social Network Growth, and Its Applications",2016,"What is the growth pattern of social networks, like Facebook and WeChat? Does it truly exhibit exponential early growth, as predicted by textbook models like the Bass model, SI, or the Branching Process? How about the count of links, over time, for which there are few published models?
 We examine the growth of several real networks, including one of the world's largest online social network, ``WeChat'', with 300 million nodes and 4.75 billion links by 2013; and we observe power law growth for both nodes and links, a fact that completely breaks the sigmoid models (like SI, and Bass). In its place, we propose NETTIDE, along with differential equations for the growth of the count of nodes, as well as links. Our model accurately fits the growth patterns of real graphs; it is general, encompassing as special cases all the known, traditional models (including Bass, SI, log-logistic growth); while still remaining parsimonious, requiring only a handful of parameters. Moreover, our NETTIDE for link growth is the first one of its kind, accurately fitting real data, and naturally leading to the densification phenomenon. We validate our model with four real, time-evolving social networks, where NETTIDE gives good fitting accuracy, and, more importantly, applied on the WeChat data, our NETTIDE forecasted more than 730 days into the future, with 3% error.",KDD
Speeding up large-scale learning with a social prior,2013,"Slow convergence and poor initial accuracy are two problems that plague efforts to use very large feature sets in online learning. This is especially true when only a few features are ""active"" in any training example, and the frequency of activations of different features is skewed. We show how these problems can be mitigated if a graph of relationships between features is known. We study this problem in a fully Bayesian setting, focusing on the problem of using Facebook user-IDs as features, with the social network giving the relationship structure. Our analysis uncovers significant problems with the obvious regularizations, and motivates a two-component mixture-model ""social prior"" that is provably better. Empirical results on large-scale click prediction problems show that our algorithm can learn as well as the baseline with 12M fewer training examples, and continuously outperforms it for over 60M examples. On a second problem using binned features, our model outperforms the baseline even after the latter sees 5x as much data.",KDD
ComSoc: adaptive transfer of user behaviors over composite social network,2012,"Accurate prediction of user behaviors is important for many social media applications, including social marketing, personalization and recommendation, etc. A major challenge lies in that, the available behavior data or interactions between users and items in a given social network are usually very limited and sparse (e.g., >= 99.9% empty). Many previous works model user behavior from only historical user logs. We observe that many people are members of several social networks in the same time, such as Facebook, Twitter and Tencent's QQ. Importantly, their behaviors and interests in different networks influence one another. This gives us an opportunity to leverage the knowledge of user behaviors in different networks, in order to alleviate the data sparsity problem, and enhance the predictive performance of user modeling. Combining different networks ""simply and naively"" does not work well. Instead, we formulate the problem to model multiple networks as ""composite network knowledge transfer"". We first select the most suitable networks inside a composite social network via a hierarchical Bayesian model, parameterized for individual users, and then build topic models for user behavior prediction using both the relationships in the selected networks and related behavior data. To handle big data, we have implemented the algorithm using Map/Reduce. We demonstrate that the proposed composite network-based user behavior model significantly improve the predictive accuracy over a number of existing approaches on several real world applications, such as a very large social-networking dataset from Tencent Inc.",KDD
Magnet community identification on social networks,2012,"Social communities connect people of similar interests together and play essential roles in social network applications. Examples of such communities include people who like the same objects on Facebook, follow common subjects on Twitter, or join similar groups on LinkedIn. Among communities, we notice that some of them are {\em magnetic} to people. A {\em magnet community} is such a community that attracts significantly more people's interests and attentions than other communities of similar topics. With the explosive number of self-formed communities in social networks, one important demand is to identify magnet communities for users. This can not only track attractive communities, but also help improve user experiences and increase their engagements, e.g., the login frequencies and user-generated-content qualities. In this paper, we initiate the study of magnet community identification problem. First we observe several properties of magnet communities, such as attention flow, attention qualify, and attention persistence. Second, we formalize these properties with the combination of community feature extraction into a graph ranking formulation based on constraint quadratic programming. In details, we treat communities of a network as super nodes, and their interactions as links among those super nodes. Therefore, a network of communities is defined. We extract community's magnet features from heterogeneous sources, i.e., a community's standalone features and its dependency features with other communities. A graph ranking model is formulated given these features. Furthermore, we define constraints reflecting communities' magnet properties to regularize the model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on real world social network data.",KDD
DeepInf: Social Influence Prediction with Deep Learning,2018,"Social and information networking activities such as on Facebook, Twitter, WeChat, and Weibo have become an indispensable part of our everyday life, where we can easily access friends' behaviors and are in turn influenced by them. Consequently, an effective social influence prediction for each user is critical for a variety of applications such as online recommendation and advertising.
 Conventional social influence prediction approaches typically design various hand-crafted rules to extract user- and network-specific features. However, their effectiveness heavily relies on the knowledge of domain experts. As a result, it is usually difficult to generalize them into different domains. Inspired by the recent success of deep neural networks in a wide range of computing applications, we design an end-to-end framework, DeepInf, to learn users' latent feature representation for predicting social influence. In general, DeepInf takes a user's local network as the input to a graph neural network for learning her latent social representation. We design strategies to incorporate both network structures and user-specific features into convolutional neural and attention networks. Extensive experiments on Open Academic Graph, Twitter, Weibo, and Digg, representing different types of social and information networks, demonstrate that the proposed end-to-end model, DeepInf, significantly outperforms traditional feature engineering-based approaches, suggesting the effectiveness of representation learning for social applications.",KDD
Structural Diversity and Homophily: A Study Across More Than One Hundred Big Networks,2017,"A widely recognized organizing principle of networks is structural homophily, which suggests that people with more common neighbors are more likely to connect with each other. However, what influence the diverse structures embedded in common neighbors have on link formation is much less well-understood. To explore this problem, we begin by characterizing the structural diversity of common neighborhoods. Using a collection of 120 large-scale networks, we demonstrate that the impact of the common neighborhood diversity on link existence can vary substantially across networks. We find that its positive effect on Facebook and negative effect on LinkedIn suggest different underlying networking needs in these networks. We also discover striking cases where diversity violates the principle of homophily---that is, where fewer mutual connections may lead to a higher tendency to link with each other. We then leverage structural diversity to develop a common neighborhood signature (CNS), which we apply to a large set of networks to uncover unique network superfamilies not discoverable by conventional methods.

Come-and-Go Patterns of Group Evolution: A Dynamic Model,2016,"How do social groups, such as Facebook groups and Wechat groups, dynamically evolve over time? How do people join the social groups, uniformly or with burst? What is the pattern of people quitting from groups? Is there a simple universal model to depict the come-and-go patterns of various groups?
 In this paper, we examine temporal evolution patterns of more than 100 thousands social groups with more than 10 million users. We surprisingly find that the evolution patterns of real social groups goes far beyond the classic dynamic models like SI and SIR. For example, we observe both diffusion and non-diffusion mechanism in the group joining process, and power-law decay in group quitting process, rather than exponential decay as expected in SIR model. Therefore we propose a new model comeNgo, a concise yet flexible dynamic model for group evolution. Our model has the following advantages: (a) unification power: it generalizes earlier theoretical models and different joining and quitting mechanisms we find from observation. (b) succinctness and interpretability: it contains only six parameters with clear physical meanings. (c) accuracy: it can capture various kinds of group evolution patterns preciously and the goodness of fit increase by 58% over baseline. (d) usefulness: it can be used in multiple application scenarios such as forecasting and pattern discovery.",KDD
Maximizing acceptance probability for active friending in online social networks,2013,"Friending recommendation has successfully contributed to the explosive growth of online social networks. Most friending recommendation services today aim to support passive friending, where a user passively selects friending targets from the recommended candidates. In this paper, we advocate a recommendation support for active friending, where a user actively specifies a friending target. To the best of our knowledge, a recommendation designed to provide guidance for a user to systematically approach his friending target has not been explored for existing online social networking services. To maximize the probability that the friending target would accept an invitation from the user, we formulate a new optimization problem, namely, Acceptance Probability Maximization (APM), and develop a polynomial time algorithm, called Selective Invitation with Tree and In-Node Aggregation (SITINA), to find the optimal solution. We implement an active friending service with SITINA on Facebook to validate our idea. Our user study and experimental results reveal that SITINA outperforms manual selection and the baseline approach in solution quality efficiently.",KDD
Similarity search in real world networks,2012,"Recently there has been a lot of interest in graph-based analysis. One of the most important aspects of graph-based analysis is to measure similarity between nodes and to do similarity search in a graph. For example, in social networks such as Facebook, system may want to recommend potential friends to a particular user based on connections between users. In custom-product networks such as eBay, one may wish to recommend products to others based on purchases history. In this talk, I will introduce some methods on vertex similarities computations and their applications on similarity search in real world networks.",KDD
dEFEND: Explainable Fake News Detection,2019,"In recent years, to mitigate the problem of fake news, computational detection of fake news has been studied, producing some promising early results. While important, however, we argue that a critical missing piece of the study be the explainability of such detection, i.e., why a particular piece of news is detected as fake. In this paper, therefore, we study the explainable detection of fake news. We develop a sentence-comment co-attention sub-network to exploit both news contents and user comments to jointly capture explainable top-k check-worthy sentences and user comments for fake news detection. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets and demonstrate that the proposed method not only significantly outperforms 7 state-of-the-art fake news detection methods by at least 5.33% in F1-score, but also (concurrently) identifies top-k user comments that explain why a news piece is fake, better than baselines by 28.2% in NDCG and 30.7% in Precision.",KDD
Optimizing Peer Referrals For Public Awareness Using Contextual Bandits,2019,"Programs that reward people for referring their friends are increasingly being used to raise awareness about important topics. With a fixed budget for referral incentives, a natural goal for such referral programs is to maximize the number of people reached. Unlike a typical influence maximization problem, however, the social network of potential adopters is unknown apriori. Further, peopleâs response to a referral incentive can depend on various factors such as their preference for the content, size of their social network, and their estimated value for sharing. Therefore, we introduce an incentive-aware variant of the influence maximization problem and formalize it under an online learning setting. Given the lack of initial information about the social network or how people respond to referral incentives, we use an explore-exploit strategy and present a contextual bandit agent CoBBI that optimizes the incentives for each user by learning from the results of its past actions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CoBBI on data from a real-world referral program for raising land rightsâ awareness among farmers. Compared to a wide range of baselines, we find that CoBBI is consistently more cost-effective, across a wide range of influence probabilities and peopleâs response to incentives.",COMPASS
Group-Fairness in Influence Maximization,2019,"Influence maximization is a widely used model for information dissemination in social networks. Recent work has employed such interventions across a wide range of social problems, spanning public health, substance abuse, and international development (to name a few examples). A critical but understudied question is whether the benefits of such interventions are fairly distributed across different groups in the population; e.g., avoiding discrimination with respect to sensitive attributes such as race or gender. Drawing on legal and game-theoretic concepts, we introduce formal definitions of fairness in influence maximization. We provide an algorithmic framework to find solutions which satisfy fairness constraints, and in the process improve the state of the art for general multi-objective submodular maximization problems. Experimental results on real data from an HIV prevention intervention for homeless youth show that standard influence maximization techniques oftentimes neglect smaller groups which contribute less to overall utility, resulting in a disparity which our proposed algorithms substantially reduce.Ã",IJCAI
Factorization Bandits for Online Influence Maximization,2019,"In this paper, we study the problem of online influence maximization in social networks. In this problem, a learner aims to identify the set of ""best influencers"" in a network by interacting with the network, i.e., repeatedly selecting seed nodes and observing activation feedback in the network. We capitalize on an important property of the influence maximization problem named network assortativity, which is ignored by most existing works in online influence maximization. To realize network assortativity, we factorize the activation probability on the edges into latent factors on the corresponding nodes, including influence factor on the giving nodes and susceptibility factor on the receiving nodes. We propose an upper confidence bound based online learning solution to estimate the latent factors, and therefore the activation probabilities. Considerable regret reduction is achieved by our factorization based online influence maximization algorithm. Extensive empirical evaluations on two real-world networks showed the effectiveness of our proposed solution.",KDD
Dual Sequential Prediction Models Linking Sequential Recommendation and Information Dissemination,2019,"Sequential recommendation and information dissemination are two traditional problems for sequential information retrieval. The common goal of the two problems is to predict future user-item interactions based on past observed interactions. The difference is that the former deals with users' histories of clicked items, while the latter focuses on items' histories of infected users.In this paper, we take a fresh view and propose dual sequential prediction models that unify these two thinking paradigms. One user-centered model takes a user's historical sequence of interactions as input, captures the user's dynamic states, and approximates the conditional probability of the next interaction for a given item based on the user's past clicking logs. By contrast, one item-centered model leverages an item's history, captures the item's dynamic states, and approximates the conditional probability of the next interaction for a given user based on the item's past infection records. To take advantage of the dual information, we design a new training mechanism which lets the two models play a game with each other and use the predicted score from the opponent to design a feedback signal to guide the training. We show that the dual models can better distinguish false negative samples and true negative samples compared with single sequential recommendation or information dissemination models. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of proposed model over some strong baselines as well as the effectiveness of dual training mechanism between two models.",KDD
Misleading Opinions Provided by Advisors: Dishonesty or Subjectivity,2013,"It is indispensable for users to evaluate the trustworthiness of other users (referred to as advisors), to cope with possible misleading opinions provided by them. Advisors' misleading opinions may be induced by their dishonest, subjectivity difference with users, or both. Existing approaches do not well distinguish the two different causes. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic graphical trust model to separately consider these two factors, involving three types of latent variables: benevolence, integrity and competence of advisors, trust propensity of users, and subjectivity difference between users and advisors. Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate that our method advances state-of-the-art approaches to a large extent.",IJCAI
Detecting Incongruity between News Headline and Body Text via a Deep Hierarchical Encoder,2019,"Some news headlines mislead readers with overrated or false information, and identifying them in advance will better assist readers in choosing proper news stories to consume. This research introduces million-scale pairs of news headline and body text dataset with incongruity label, which can uniquely be utilized for detecting news stories with misleading headlines. On this dataset, we develop two neural networks with hierarchical architectures that model a complex textual representation of news articles and measure the incongruity between the headline and the body text. We also present a data augmentation method that dramatically reduces the text input size a model handles by independently investigating each paragraph of news stories, which further boosts the performance. Our experiments and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform existing approaches and efficiently detect news stories with misleading headlines in the real world.",AAAI
Topic dynamics: an alternative model of bursts in streams of topics,2010,"For some time there has been increasing interest in the problem of monitoring the occurrence of topics in a stream of events, such as a stream of news articles. This has led to different models of bursts in these streams, i.e., periods of elevated occurrence of events. Today there are several burst definitions and detection algorithms, and their differences can produce very different results in topic streams. These definitions also share a fundamental problem: they define bursts in terms of an arrival rate. This approach is limiting; other stream dimensions can matter.
 We reconsider the idea of bursts from the standpoint of a simple kind of physics. Instead of focusing on arrival rates, we reconstruct bursts as a dynamic phenomenon, using kinetics concepts from physics -- mass and velocity -- and derive momentum, acceleration, and force from these. We refer to the result as topic dynamics, permitting a hierarchical, expressive model of bursts as intervals of increasing momentum. As a sample application, we present a topic dynamics model for the large PubMed/MEDLINE database of biomedical publications, using the MeSH (Medical Subject Heading) topic hierarchy. We show our model is able to detect bursts for MeSH terms accurately as well as efficiently.",KDD
Who Blames Whom in a Crisis? Detecting Blame Ties from News Articles Using Neural Networks,2019,"Blame games tend to follow major disruptions, be they financial crises, natural disasters or terrorist attacks. To study how the blame game evolves and shapes the dominant crisis narratives is of great significance, as sense-making processes can affect regulatory outcomes, social hierarchies, and cultural norms. However, it takes tremendous time and efforts for social scientists to manually examine each relevant news article and extract the blame ties (A blames B). In this study, we define a new task, Blame Tie Extraction, and construct a new dataset related to the United States financial crisis (20072010) from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and USA Today. We build a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network for contexts where the entities appear in and it learns to automatically extract such blame ties at the document level. Leveraging the large unsupervised model such as GloVe and ELMo, our best model achieves an F1 score of 70% on the test set for blame tie extraction, making it a useful tool for social scientists to extract blame ties more efficiently.",AAAI
How to Compete Online for News Audience: Modeling Words that Attract Clicks,2016,"Headlines are particularly important for online news outlets where there are many similar news stories competing for users' attention. Traditionally, journalists have followed rules-of-thumb and experience to master the art of crafting catchy headlines, but with the valuable resource of large-scale click-through data of online news articles, we can apply quantitative analysis and text mining techniques to acquire an in-depth understanding of headlines. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale analysis and modeling of 150K news articles published over a period of four months on the Yahoo home page. We define a simple method to measure click-value of individual words, and analyze how temporal trends and linguistic attributes affect click-through rate (CTR). We then propose a novel generative model, headline click-based topic model (HCTM), that extends latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to reveal the effect of topical context on the click-value of words in headlines. HCTM leverages clicks in aggregate on previously published headlines to identify words for headlines that will generate more clicks in the future. We show that by jointly taking topics and clicks into account we can detect changes in user interests within topics. We evaluate HCTM in two different experimental settings and compare its performance with ALDA (adapted LDA), LDA, and TextRank. The first task, full headline, is to retrieve full headline used for a news article given the body of news article. The second task, good headline, is to specifically identify words in the headline that have high click values for current news audience. For full headline task, our model performs on par with ALDA, a state-of-the art web-page summarization method that utilizes click-through information. For good headline task, which is of more practical importance to both individual journalists and online news outlets, our model significantly outperforms all other comparative methods.",KDD
Tracking trends: incorporating term volume into temporal topic models,2011,"Text corpora with documents from a range of time epochs are natural and ubiquitous in many fields, such as research papers, newspaper articles and a variety of types of recently emerged social media. People not only would like to know what kind of topics can be found from these data sources but also wish to understand the temporal dynamics of these topics and predict certain properties of terms or documents in the future. Topic models are usually utilized to find latent topics from text collections, and recently have been applied to temporal text corpora. However, most proposed models are general purpose models to which no real tasks are explicitly associated. Therefore, current models may be difficult to apply in real-world applications, such as the problems of tracking trends and predicting popularity of keywords. In this paper, we introduce a real-world task, tracking trends of terms, to which temporal topic models can be applied. Rather than building a general-purpose model, we propose a new type of topic model that incorporates the volume of terms into the temporal dynamics of topics and optimizes estimates of term volumes. In existing models, trends are either latent variables or not considered at all which limits the potential for practical use of trend information. In contrast, we combine state-space models with term volumes with a supervised learning model, enabling us to effectively predict the volume in the future, even without new documents. In addition, it is straightforward to obtain the volume of latent topics as a by-product of our model, demonstrating the superiority of utilizing temporal topic models over traditional time-series tools (e.g., autoregressive models) to tackle this kind of problem. The proposed model can be further extended with arbitrary word-level features which are evolving over time. We present the results of applying the model to two datasets with long time periods and show its effectiveness over non-trivial baselines.",KDD
Information cascade at group scale,2013,"Identifying the k most influential individuals in a social network is a well-studied problem. The objective is to detect k individuals in a (social) network who will influence the maximum number of people, if they are independently convinced of adopting a new strategy (product, idea, etc). There are cases in real life, however, where we aim to instigate groups instead of individuals to trigger network diffusion. Such cases abound, e.g., billboards, TV commercials and newspaper ads are utilized extensively to boost the popularity and raise awareness.
 In this paper, we generalize the ""influential nodes"" problem. Namely we are interested to locate the most ""influential groups"" in a network. As the first paper to address this problem: we (1) propose a fine-grained model of information diffusion for the group-based problem, (2) show that the process is submodular and present an algorithm to determine the influential groups under this model (with a precise approximation bound), (3) propose a coarse-grained model that inspects the network at group level (not individuals) significantly speeding up calculations for large networks, (4) show that the diffusion function we design here is submodular in general case, and propose an approximation algorithm for this coarse-grained model, and finally by conducting experiments on real datasets, (5) demonstrate that seeding members of selected groups to be the first adopters can broaden diffusion (when compared to the influential individuals case). Moreover, we can identify these influential groups much faster (up to 12 million times speedup), delivering a practical solution to this problem.",KDD
Efficient computation of personal aggregate queries on blogs,2008,"There is an exploding amount of user-generated content on theWeb due to the emergence of ""Web 2.0"" services, such as Blogger,MySpace, Flickr, and del.icio.us. The participation of a large number of users in sharing their opinion on the Web has inspired researchers to build an effective ""information filter"" by aggregating these independent opinions. However, given the diverse groups of users on the Web nowadays, the global aggregation of the information may not be of much interest to different groups of users. In this paper, we explore the possibility of computing personalized aggregation over the opinions expressed on the Web based on a user's indication of trust over the information sources. The hope is that by employing such ""personalized"" aggregation, we can make the recommendation more likely to be interesting to the users. We address the challenging scalability issues by proposing an efficient method, that utilizes two core techniques: Non-Negative Matrix Factorization and Threshold Algorithm, to compute personalized aggregations when there are potentially millions of users and millions of sources within a system. We show that, through experiments on real-life dataset, our personalized aggregation approach indeed makes a significant difference in the items that are recommended and it reduces the query computational cost significantly, often more than 75%, while the result of personalized aggregation is kept accurate enough.",KDD
Unsupervised link prediction using aggregative statistics on heterogeneous social networks,2013,"The concern of privacy has become an important issue for online social networks. In services such as Foursquare.com, whether a person likes an article is considered private and therefore not disclosed; only the aggregative statistics of articles (i.e., how many people like this article) is revealed. This paper tries to answer a question: can we predict the opinion holder in a heterogeneous social network without any labeled data? This question can be generalized to a link prediction with aggregative statistics problem. This paper devises a novel unsupervised framework to solve this problem, including two main components: (1) a three-layer factor graph model and three types of potential functions; (2) a ranked-margin learning and inference algorithm. Finally, we evaluate our method on four diverse prediction scenarios using four datasets: preference (Foursquare), repost (Twitter), response (Plurk), and citation (DBLP). We further exploit nine unsupervised models to solve this problem as baselines. Our approach not only wins out in all scenarios, but on the average achieves 9.90% AUC and 12.59% NDCG improvement over the best competitors.

A Temporally Heterogeneous Survival Framework with Application to Social Behavior Dynamics,2017,"Social behavior dynamics is one of the central building blocks in understanding and modeling complex social dynamic phenomena, such as information spreading, opinion formation, and social mobilization. While a wide range of models for social behavior dynamics have been proposed in recent years, the essential ingredients and the minimum model for social behavior dynamics is still largely unanswered. Here, we find that human interaction behavior dynamics exhibit rich complexities over the response time dimension and natural time dimension by exploring a large scale social communication dataset. To tackle this challenge, we develop a temporal Heterogeneous Survival framework where the regularities in response time dimension and natural time dimension can be organically integrated. We apply our model in two online social communication datasets. Our model can successfully regenerate the interaction patterns in the social communication datasets, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly outperform other state-of-the-art baselines. Meanwhile, the learnt parameters and discovered statistical regularities can lead to multiple potential applications.",KDD
Improving Survey Aggregation with Sparsely Represented Signals,2016,"In this paper, we develop a new aggregation technique to reduce the cost of surveying. Our method aims to jointly estimate a vector of target quantities such as public opinion or voter intent across time and maintain good estimates when using only a fraction of the data. Inspired by the James-Stein estimator, we resolve this challenge by shrinking the estimates to a global mean which is assumed to have a sparse representation in some known basis. This assumption has lead to two different methods for estimating the global mean: orthogonal matching pursuit and deep learning. Both of which significantly reduce the number of samples needed to achieve good estimates of the true means of the data and, in the case of presidential elections, can estimate the outcome of the 2012 United States elections while saving hundreds of thousands of samples and maintaining accuracy.",KDD
Confluence: conformity influence in large social networks,2013,"Conformity is a type of social influence involving a change in opinion or behavior in order to fit in with a group. Employing several social networks as the source for our experimental data, we study how the effect of conformity plays a role in changing users' online behavior. We formally define several major types of conformity in individual, peer, and group levels. We propose Confluence model to formalize the effects of social conformity into a probabilistic model. Confluence can distinguish and quantify the effects of the different types of conformities. To scale up to large social networks, we propose a distributed learning method that can construct the Confluence model efficiently with near-linear speedup. Our experimental results on four different types of large social networks, i.e., Flickr, Gowalla, Weibo and Co-Author, verify the existence of the conformity phenomena. Leveraging the conformity information, Confluence can accurately predict actions of users. Our experiments show that Confluence significantly improves the prediction accuracy by up to 5-10% compared with several alternative methods.",KDD
Social Pressure in Opinion Games,2017,"Motivated by privacy and security concerns in online social networks, we study the role of social pressure in opinion games. These are games, important in economics and sociology, that model the formation of opinions in a social network. We enrich the definition of (noisy) best-response dynamics for opinion games by introducing the pressure, increasing with time, to reach an agreement.We prove that for clique social networks, the dynamics always converges to consensus (no matter the level of noise) if the social pressure is high enough. Moreover, we provide (tight) bounds on the speed of convergence; these bounds are polynomial in the number of players provided that the pressure grows sufficiently fast.We finally look beyond cliques: we characterize the graphs for which consensus is guaranteed, and make some considerations on the computational complexity of checking whether a graph satisfies such a condition.",IJCAI
Empirical Analysis of the Presence of Power Elite in Media (NOTE),2018,"Politicians, politically connected business persons, bureaucrats, celebrities, and highly placed government officials (collectively termed as the power elite in sociology literature) can influence national and regional policy for personal and organizational benefit, which may not always be in the best interests of the people. Media is a crucial tool to shape public opinion, and is used heavily by the power elite to bring legitimacy to their policy decisions. In this paper, we empirically analyze the coverage given to the power elite in mainstream media on Demonetization, a significant, recent policy event in India. We compare the extent of coverage given to the elite and non-elite, the policy slant expressed by them, and differences in coverage between seven of the largest news media organizations in India. We find that among the power elite, powerful politicians and political parties are given the maximum coverage in the media, with conspicuous negligence in coverage given to expert opinions. Sentiment analysis clearly reveals that opposing political factions express opposing views towards the policy, and there is variation across different news sources as well. We are applying our methods on other contentious policy events to be able to do a more systematic analysis of how media can aid the power elite to shape public opinion by giving them disproportionately large coverage and visibility.",COMPASS
Collective Opinion Spam Detection: Bridging Review Networks and Metadata,2015,"Online reviews capture the testimonials of ""real"" people and help shape the decisions of other consumers. Due to the financial gains associated with positive reviews, however, opinion spam has become a widespread problem, with often paid spam reviewers writing fake reviews to unjustly promote or demote certain products or businesses. Existing approaches to opinion spam have successfully but separately utilized linguistic clues of deception, behavioral footprints, or relational ties between agents in a review system.
 In this work, we propose a new holistic approach called SPEAGLE that utilizes clues from all metadata (text, timestamp, rating) as well as relational data (network), and harness them collectively under a unified framework to spot suspicious users and reviews, as well as products targeted by spam. Moreover, our method can efficiently and seamlessly integrate semi-supervision, i.e., a (small) set of labels if available, without requiring any training or changes in its underlying algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of SPEAGLE on three real-world review datasets from Yelp.com with filtered (spam) and recommended (non-spam) reviews, where it significantly outperforms several baselines and state-of-the-art methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest scale quantitative evaluation performed to date for the opinion spam problem.",KDD
Egocentric Bias and Doubt in Cognitive Agents (Page 286),2019,"Modeling social interactions based on individual behavior has al-ways been an area of interest, but prior literature generally pre-sumes rational behavior. Thus, such models may miss out on cap-turing the effects of biases humans are susceptible to. This workpresents a method to model egocentric bias, the real-life tendencyto emphasize oneâs own opinion heavily when presented with mul-tiple opinions. We use a symmetric distribution, centered at anagentâs own opinion, as opposed to the Bounded Confidence (BC)model used in prior work. We consider a game of iterated interac-tions where an agent cooperates based on its opinion about an op-ponent. Our model also includes the concept of domain-based self-doubt, which varies as the interaction succeeds or not. An increasein doubt makes an agent reduce its egocentricity in subsequent in-teractions, thus enabling the agent to learn reactively. The agentsystem is modeled with factions not having a single leader, to over-come some of the issues associated with leader-follower factions.We find that agents belonging to factions perform better than in-dividual agents. We observe that an intermediate level of egocen-tricity helps the agent perform at its best, which concurs with con-ventional wisdom that neither overconfidence nor low self-esteembrings benefits.",AAMAS
The Volatility of Weak Ties: Co-evolution of Selection and Influence in Social Networks (Page 619),2019,"In this work we look at opinion formation and the effects of two phenomena both of which promote consensus between agents connected by ties: influence, agents changing their opinions to match their neighbors; and selection, agents re-wiring to connect to new agents when the existing neighbor has a different opinion. In our agent-based model, we assume that only weak ties can be rewired and strong ties do not change. The network structure as well as the opinion landscape thus co-evolve with two important parameters: the probability of influence versus selection; and the fraction of strong ties versus weak ties. Using empirical and theoretical methodologies we discovered that on a two-dimensional spatial network: \beginitemize \item With no/low selection the presence of weak ties enables fast consensus. This conforms with the classical theory that weak ties are helpful for quickly mixing and spreading information, and strong ties alone act much more slowly. \item With high selection, too many weak ties inhibit any consensus at all---the graph partitions. The weak ties reinforce the differing opinions rather than mixing them. However, sufficiently many strong ties promote convergence, though at a slower pace. \enditemize We additionally test the aforementioned results using a real network. Our study relates two theoretical ideas: the strength of weak ties---that weak ties are useful for spreading information; and the idea of echo chambers or filter bubbles, that people are typically bombarded by the opinions of like-minded individuals. The difference is in how (much) selection operates.",AAMAS
Debiasing social wisdom,2013,"With the explosive growth of social networks, many applications are increasingly harnessing the pulse of online crowds for a variety of tasks such as marketing, advertising, and opinion mining. An important example is the wisdom of crowd effect that has been well studied for such tasks when the crowd is non-interacting. However, these studies don't explicitly address the network effects in social networks. A key difference in this setting is the presence of social influences that arise from these interactions and can undermine the wisdom of the crowd [17].
 Using a natural model of opinion formation, we analyze the effect of these interactions on an individual's opinion and estimate her propensity to conform. We then propose efficient sampling algorithms incorporating these conformity values to arrive at a debiased estimate of the wisdom of a crowd. We analyze the trade-off between the sample size and estimation error and validate our algorithms using both real data obtained from online user experiments and synthetic data.",KDD
From labor to trader: opinion elicitation via online crowds as a market,2014,"We often care about people's degrees of belief about certain events: e.g. causality between an action and the outcomes, odds distribution among the outcome of a horse race and so on. It is well recognized that the best form to elicit opinion from human is probability distribution instead of simple voting, because the form of distribution retains the delicate information that an opinion expresses. In the past, opinion elicitation has relied on experts, who are expensive and not always available. More recently, crowdsourcing has gained prominence as an inexpensive way to get a great deal of human input. However, traditional crowdsourcing has primarily focused on issuing very simple (e.g. binary decision) tasks to the crowd. In this paper, we study how to use crowds for Opinion Elicitation. There are three major challenges to eliciting opinion information in the form of probability distributions: how to measure the quality of distribution; how to aggregate the distributions; and, how to strategically implement such a system.
 To address these challenges, we design and implement COPE Crowd-powered OPinion Elicitation market. COPE models crowdsourced work as a trading market, where the ""workers"" behave like ""traders"" to maximize their profit by presenting their opinion. Among the innovative features in this system, we design COPE updating to combine the multiple elicited distributions following a Bayesian scheme. Also to provide more flexibility while running COPE, we propose a series of efficient algorithms and a slope based strategy to manage the ending condition of COPE. We then demonstrate the implementation of COPE and report experimental results running on real commercial platform to demonstrate the practical value of this system.",KDD
Partitioned Sampling of Public Opinions Based on Their Social Dynamics,2017,"Public opinion polling is usually done by random sampling from the entire population, treating individual opinions as independent. In the real world, individuals' opinions are often correlated, e.g., among friends in a social network. In this paper, we explore the idea of partitioned sampling, which partitions individuals with high opinion similarities into groups and then samples every group separately to obtain an accurate estimate of the population opinion. We rigorously formulate the above idea as an optimization problem. We then show that the simple partitions which contain only one sample in each group are always better, and reduce finding the optimal simple partition to a well-studied Min-r-Partition problem. We adapt an approximation algorithm and a heuristic algorithm to solve the optimization problem. Moreover, to obtain opinion similarity efficiently, we adapt a well-known opinion evolution model to characterize social interactions, and provide an exact computation of opinion similarities based on the model. We use both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate that the partitioned sampling method results in significant improvement in sampling quality and it is robust when some opinion similarities are inaccurate or even missing.",AAAI
Fighting Opinion Control in Social Networks via Link Recommendation,2019,"The process of opinion formation is inherently a network process, with user opinions in a social network being driven to a certain average opinion. One simple and intuitive incarnation of this opinion attractor is the average of user opinions weighted by the users' eigenvector centralities. This value is a lucrative target for control, as altering it essentially changes the mass opinion in the network. Since any potentially malicious influence upon the opinion distribution in a society is undesirable, it is important to design methods to prevent external attacks upon it. In this work, we assume that the adversary aims to maliciously change the network's average opinion by altering the opinions of some unknown users. We, then, state an NP-hard problem of disabling such opinion control attempts via strategically altering the network's users' eigencentralities by recommending a limited number of links to the users. Relying on Markov chain theory, we provide perturbation analysis that shows how eigencentrality and, hence, our problem's objective change in response to a link's addition to the network. The latter leads to the design of a pseudo-linear-time heuristic, relying on efficient estimation of mean first passage times in Markov chains. We have confirmed our theoretical and algorithmic findings, and studied effectiveness and efficiency of our heuristic in experiments with synthetic and real networks.",KDD
Automatic selection of social media responses to news,2013,"Social media responses to news have increasingly gained in importance as they can enhance a consumer's news reading experience, promote information sharing and aid journalists in assessing their readership's response to a story. Given that the number of responses to an online news article may be huge, a common challenge is that of selecting only the most interesting responses for display. This paper addresses this challenge by casting message selection as an optimization problem. We define an objective function which jointly models the messages' utility scores and their entropy. We propose a near-optimal solution to the underlying optimization problem, which leverages the submodularity property of the objective function. Our solution first learns the utility of individual messages in isolation and then produces a diverse selection of interesting messages by maximizing the defined objective function. The intuitions behind our work are that an interesting selection of messages contains diverse, informative, opinionated and popular messages referring to the news article, written mostly by users that have authority on the topic. Our intuitions are embodied by a rich set of content, social and user features capturing the aforementioned aspects. We evaluate our approach through both human and automatic experiments, and demonstrate it outperforms the state of the art. Additionally, we perform an in-depth analysis of the annotated ``interesting'' responses, shedding light on the subjectivity around the selection process and the perception of interestingness.",KDD
Spotting opinion spammers using behavioral footprints,2013,"Opinionated social media such as product reviews are now widely used by individuals and organizations for their decision making. However, due to the reason of profit or fame, people try to game the system by opinion spamming (e.g., writing fake reviews) to promote or to demote some target products. In recent years, fake review detection has attracted significant attention from both the business and research communities. However, due to the difficulty of human labeling needed for supervised learning and evaluation, the problem remains to be highly challenging. This work proposes a novel angle to the problem by modeling spamicity as latent. An unsupervised model, called Author Spamicity Model (ASM), is proposed. It works in the Bayesian setting, which facilitates modeling spamicity of authors as latent and allows us to exploit various observed behavioral footprints of reviewers. The intuition is that opinion spammers have different behavioral distributions than non-spammers. This creates a distributional divergence between the latent population distributions of two clusters: spammers and non-spammers. Model inference results in learning the population distributions of the two clusters. Several extensions of ASM are also considered leveraging from different priors. Experiments on a real-life Amazon review dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models which significantly outperform the state-of-the-art competitors.",KDD
The Co-Evolution Model for Social Network Evolving and Opinion Migration,2017,"Almost all real-world social networks are dynamic and evolving with time, where new links may form and old links may drop, largely determined by the homophily of social actors (i.e., nodes in the network). Meanwhile, (latent) properties of social actors, such as their opinions, are changing along the time, partially due to social influence received from the network, which will in turn affect the network structure. Social network evolution and node property migration are usually treated as two orthogonal problems, and have been studied separately. In this paper, we propose a co-evolution model that closes the loop by modeling the two phenomena together, which contains two major components: (1) a network generative model when the node property is known; and (2) a property migration model when the social network structure is known. Simulation shows that our model has several nice properties: (1) it can model a broad range of phenomena such as opinion convergence (i.e., herding) and community-based opinion divergence; and (2) it allows to control the evolution via a set of factors such as social influence scope, opinion leader, and noise level. Finally, the usefulness of our model is demonstrated by an application of co-sponsorship prediction for legislative bills in Congress, which outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines.",KDD
WiseMarket: a new paradigm for managing wisdom of online social users,2013,"The benefits of crowdsourcing are well-recognized today for an increasingly broad range of problems. Meanwhile, the rapid development of social media makes it possible to seek the wisdom of a crowd of targeted users. However, it is not trivial to implement the crowdsourcing platform on social media, specifically to make social media users as workers, we need to address the following two challenges: 1) how to motivate users to participate in tasks, and 2) how to choose users for a task. In this paper, we present Wise Market as an effective framework for crowdsourcing on social media that motivates users to participate in a task with care and correctly aggregates their opinions on pairwise choice problems. The Wise Market consists of a set of investors each with an associated individual confidence in his/her prediction, and after the investment, only the ones whose choices are the same as the whole market are granted rewards. Therefore, a social media user has to give his/her ``best'' answer in order to get rewards, as a consequence, careless answers from sloppy users are discouraged.
 Under the Wise Market framework, we define an optimization problem to minimize expected cost of paying out rewards while guaranteeing a minimum confidence level, called the Effective Market Problem (EMP). We propose exact algorithms for calculating the market confidence and the expected cost with O(nlog2n) time cost in a Wise Market with n investors. To deal with the enormous number of users on social media, we design a Central Limit Theorem-based approximation algorithm to compute the market confidence with O(n) time cost, as well as a bounded approximation algorithm to calculate the expected cost with O(n) time cost. Finally, we have conducted extensive experiments to validate effectiveness of the proposed algorithms on real and synthetic data.",KDD
Inferring Multi-Dimensional Ideal Points for US Supreme Court Justices,2016,"In Supreme Court parlance and the political science literature, an ideal point positions a justice in a continuous space and can be interpreted as a quantification of the justice's policy preferences. We present an automated approach to infer such ideal points for justices of the US Supreme Court. This approach combines topic modeling over case opinions with the voting (and endorsing) behavior of justices. Furthermore, given a topic of interest, say the Fourth Amendment, the topic model can be optionally seeded with supervised information to steer the inference of ideal points. Application of this methodology over five years of cases provides interesting perspectives into the leaning of justices on crucial issues, coalitions underlying specific topics, and the role of swing justices in deciding the outcomes of cases.",AAAI
Opinion-aware Knowledge Graph for Political Ideology Detection,2017,"Identifying individual's political ideology from their speeches and written texts is important for analyzing political opinions and user behavior on social media. Traditional opinion mining methods rely on bag-of-words representations to classify texts into different ideology categories. Such methods are too coarse for understanding political ideologies. The key to identify different ideologies is to recognize different opinions expressed toward a specific topic. To model this insight, we classify ideologies based on the distribution of opinions expressed towards real-world entities or topics. Specifically, we propose a novel approach to political ideology detection that makes predictions based on an opinion-aware knowledge graph. We show how to construct such graph by integrating the opinions and targeted entities extracted from text into an existing structured knowledge base, and show how to perform ideology inference by information propagation on the graph. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high accuracy in detecting ideologies compared to baselines including LR, SVM and RNN.",IJCAI
Opinion Dynamics with Varying Susceptibility to Persuasion,2018,"A long line of work in social psychology has studied variations in people's susceptibility to persuasion -- the extent to which they are willing to modify their opinions on a topic. This body of literature suggests an interesting perspective on theoretical models of opinion formation on social networks: in addition to considering interventions that directly modify people's intrinsic opinions, it is also natural to consider those that modify people's susceptibility to persuasion. Here, we adopt a popular model for social opinion dynamics, and formalize the opinion maximization and minimization problems where interventions happen at the level of susceptibility. We show that modeling interventions at the level of susceptibility leads to an interesting family of new questions in network opinion dynamics. We find that the questions are quite different depending on whether there is an overall budget constraining the number of agents we can target or not. We give a polynomial-time algorithm for finding the optimal target-set to optimize the sum of opinions when there are no budget constraints on the size of the target-set. We show that this problem is NP-hard when there is a budget, and that the objective function is neither submodular nor supermodular. Finally, we propose a heuristic for the budgeted opinion optimization problem and show its efficacy at finding target-sets that optimize the sum of opinions on real world networks, including a Twitter network with real opinion estimates.",KDD
Quantifying herding effects in crowd wisdom,2014,"In many diverse settings, aggregated opinions of others play an increasingly dominant role in shaping individual decision making. One key prerequisite of harnessing the ""crowd wisdom"" is the independency of individuals' opinions, yet in real settings collective opinions are rarely simple aggregations of independent minds. Recent experimental studies document that disclosing prior collective opinions distorts individuals' decision making as well as their perceptions of quality and value, highlighting a fundamental disconnect from current modeling efforts: How to model social influence and its impact on systems that are constantly evolving? In this paper, we develop a mechanistic framework to model social influence of prior collective opinions (e.g., online product ratings) on subsequent individual decision making. We find our method successfully captures the dynamics of rating growth, helping us separate social influence bias from inherent values. Using large-scale longitudinal customer rating datasets, we demonstrate that our model not only effectively assesses social influence bias, but also accurately predicts long-term cumulative growth of ratings solely based on early rating trajectories. We believe our framework will play an increasingly important role as our understanding of social processes deepens. It promotes strategies to untangle manipulations and social biases and provides insights towards a more reliable and effective design of social platforms.",KDD
Quantifying and Minimizing Risk of Conflict in Social Networks,2018,"Controversy, disagreement, conflict, polarization and opinion divergence in social networks have been the subject of much recent research. In particular, researchers have addressed the question of how such concepts can be quantified given people's prior opinions, and how they can be optimized by influencing the opinion of a small number of people or by editing the network's connectivity.
 Here, rather than optimizing such concepts given a specific set of prior opinions, we study whether they can be optimized in the average case and in the worst case over all sets of prior opinions. In particular, we derive the worst-case and average-case conflict risk of networks, and we propose algorithms for optimizing these. For some measures of conflict, these are non-convex optimization problems with many local minima. We provide a theoretical and empirical analysis of the nature of some of these local minima, and show how they are related to existing organizational structures.
 Empirical results show how a small number of edits quickly decreases its conflict risk, both average-case and worst-case. Furthermore, it shows that minimizing average-case conflict risk often does not reduce worst-case conflict risk. Minimizing worst-case conflict risk on the other hand, while computationally more challenging, is generally effective at minimizing both worst-case as well as average-case conflict risk.",KDD
User grouping behavior in online forums,2009,"Online forums represent one type of social media that is particularly rich for studying human behavior in information seeking and diffusing. The way users join communities is a reflection of the changing and expanding of their interests toward information. In this paper, we study the patterns of user participation behavior, and the feature factors that influence such behavior on different forum datasets. We find that, despite the relative randomness and lesser commitment of structural relationships in online forums, users' community joining behaviors display some strong regularities. One particularly interesting observation is that the very weak relationships between users defined by online replies have similar diffusion curves as those of real friendships or co-authorships. We build social selection models, Bipartite Markov Random Field (BiMRF), to quantitatively evaluate the prediction performance of those feature factors and their relationships. Using these models, we show that some features carry supplementary information, and the effectiveness of different features vary in different types of forums. Moreover, the results of BiMRF with two-star configurations suggest that the feature of user similarity defined by frequency of communication or number of common friends is inadequate to predict grouping behavior, but adding node-level features can improve the fit of the model.",KDD
NetWalk: A Flexible Deep Embedding Approach for Anomaly Detection in Dynamic Networks,2018,"Massive and dynamic networks arise in many practical applications such as social media, security and public health. Given an evolutionary network, it is crucial to detect structural anomalies, such as vertices and edges whose ""behaviors'' deviate from underlying majority of the network, in a real-time fashion. Recently, network embedding has proven a powerful tool in learning the low-dimensional representations of vertices in networks that can capture and preserve the network structure. However, most existing network embedding approaches are designed for static networks, and thus may not be perfectly suited for a dynamic environment in which the network representation has to be constantly updated. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, NetWalk, for anomaly detection in dynamic networks by learning network representations which can be updated dynamically as the network evolves. We first encode the vertices of the dynamic network to vector representations by clique embedding, which jointly minimizes the pairwise distance of vertex representations of each walk derived from the dynamic networks, and the deep autoencoder reconstruction error serving as a global regularization. The vector representations can be computed with constant space requirements using reservoir sampling. On the basis of the learned low-dimensional vertex representations, a clustering-based technique is employed to incrementally and dynamically detect network anomalies. Compared with existing approaches, NetWalk has several advantages: 1) the network embedding can be updated dynamically, 2) streaming network nodes and edges can be encoded efficiently with constant memory space usage, 3). flexible to be applied on different types of networks, and 4) network anomalies can be detected in real-time. Extensive experiments on four real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of NetWalk.",KDD
Region-Based Message Exploration over Spatio-Temporal Data Streams,2019,"Massive amount of spatio-temporal data that contain location and text content are being generated by location-based social media. These spatio-temporal messages cover a wide range of topics. It is of great significance to discover local trending topics based on usersÃ¢â¬â¢ location-based and topicbased requirements. We develop a region-based message exploration mechanism that retrieve spatio-temporal message clusters from a stream of spatio-temporal messages based on usersÃ¢â¬â¢ preferences on message topic and message spatial distribution. Additionally, we propose a region summarization algorithm that finds a subset of representative messages in a cluster to summarize the topics and the spatial attributes of messages in the cluster. We evaluate the efficacy and efficiency of our proposal on two real-world datasets and the results demonstrate that our solution is capable of high efficiency and effectiveness compared with baselines.",AAAI
Tracking Idea Flows between Social Groups,2016,"In many applications, ideas that are described by a set of words often flow between different groups. To facilitate users in analyzing the flow, we present a method to model the flow behaviors that aims at identifying the lead-lag relationships between word clusters of different user groups. In particular, an improved Bayesian conditional cointegration based on dynamic time warping is employed to learn links between words in different groups. A tensor-based technique is developed to cluster these linked words into different clusters (ideas) and track the flow of ideas. The main feature of the tensor representation is that we introduce two additional dimensions to represent both time and lead-lag relationships. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show that our method is more effective than methods based on traditional clustering techniques and achieves better accuracy. A case study was conducted to demonstrate the usefulness of our method in helping users understand the flow of ideas between different user groups on social media.",AAAI
Modeling Status Theory in Trust Prediction,2015,"With the pervasion of social media, trust has been playing more of an important role in helping online users collect reliable information. In reality, user-specified trust relations are often very sparse; hence, inferring unknown trust relations has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Social status is one of the most important concepts in trust, and status theory is developed to help us understand the important role of social status in the formation of trust relations. In this paper, we investigate how to exploit social status in trust prediction by modeling status theory. We first vertify status theory in trust relations, then provide a principled way to model it mathematically, and propose a novel framework sTrust which incorporates status theory for trust prediction. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Futher experiments are conducted to understand the importance of status theory in trust prediction.",AAAI
DenseAlert: Incremental Dense-Subtensor Detection in Tensor Streams,2017,"Consider a stream of retweet events - how can we spot fraudulent lock-step behavior in such multi-aspect data (i.e., tensors) evolving over time? Can we detect it in real time, with an accuracy guarantee? Past studies have shown that dense subtensors tend to indicate anomalous or even fraudulent behavior in many tensor data, including social media, Wikipedia, and TCP dumps. Thus, several algorithms have been proposed for detecting dense subtensors rapidly and accurately. However, existing algorithms assume that tensors are static, while many real-world tensors, including those mentioned above, evolve over time.
 We propose DENSESTREAM, an incremental algorithm that maintains and updates a dense subtensor in a tensor stream (i.e., a sequence of changes in a tensor), and DENSESALERT, an incremental algorithm spotting the sudden appearances of dense subtensors. Our algorithms are: (1) Fast and ""any time"": updates by our algorithms are up to a million times faster than the fastest batch algorithms, (2) Provably accurate: our algorithms guarantee a lower bound on the density of the subtensor they maintain, and (3) Effective: our DENSESALERT successfully spots anomalies in real-world tensors, especially those overlooked by existing algorithms.",KDD
Efficient Nonparametric Subgraph Detection Using Tree Shaped Priors,2016,"Non-parametric graph scan (NPGS) statistics are used to detect anomalous connected subgraphs on graphs, and have a wide variety of applications, such as disease outbreak detection, road traffic congestion detection, and event detection in social media. In contrast to traditional parametric scan statistics (e.g., the Kulldorff statistic), NPGS statistics are free of distributional assumptions and can be applied to heterogeneous graph data. In this paper, we make a number of contributions to the computational study of NPGS statistics. First, we present a novel reformulation of the problem as a sequence of Budget Price-Collecting Steiner Tree (B-PCST) sub-problems. Second, we show that this reformulated problem is NP-hard for a large class of nonparametric statistic functions. Third, we further develop efficient exact and approximate algorithms for a special category of graphs in which the anomalous subgraphs can be reformulated in a fixed tree topology. Finally, using extensive experiments we demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithms in two real-world application domains (water pollution detection in water sensor networks and spatial event detection in social media networks) and contrast against state-of-the-art connected subgraph detection methods.",AAAI
Dynamics of news events and social media reaction,2014,"The analysis of social sentiment expressed on the Web is becoming increasingly relevant to a variety of applications, and it is important to understand the underlying mechanisms which drive the evolution of sentiments in one way or another, in order to be able to predict these changes in the future. In this paper, we study the dynamics of news events and their relation to changes of sentiment expressed on relevant topics. We propose a novel framework, which models the behavior of news and social media in response to events as a convolution between event's importance and media response function, specific to media and event type. This framework is suitable for detecting time and duration of events, as well as their impact and dynamics, from time series of publication volume. These data can greatly enhance events analysis; for instance, they can help distinguish important events from unimportant, or predict sentiment and stock market shifts. As an example of such application, we extracted news events for a variety of topics and then correlated this data with the corresponding sentiment time series, revealing the connection between sentiment shifts and event dynamics.",KDD
"Analysis Of Parliamentary Question Hour Data, Mass Media Data, And Social Media Data To Study The Discourse On Policies",2019,"The parliament, media, and citizens, are key stakeholders in any democracy. We study their priorities pertaining to four economic policies in India - Demonetization, Aadhaar, GST, and Farmers' Protests - by examining the content of questions asked by politicians in the parliament, news articles published in the mass media, and data from social media. We find that the mass media covers stories about different constituencies (the poor, middle-class, corporates, etc.) but shows biases in terms of which constituencies it chooses to focus on for each policy. The parliament tends to focus on procedural aspects of the policies. We also find that the social media simply echoes the trends of whatever is emphasized more in the mass media, without much deviation in the attention placed by social media users on different issues. We further find out that instead of selecting issues of importance based on feedback from citizens, the parliamentarians mostly indulge in partisanship, and shape their questions based on party goals that change depending on whether their party is in power or not. Overall, we are able to use this analysis to comment on how representative and responsive the Indian democracy is to its citizens.",COMPASS
From user comments to on-line conversations,2012,"We present an analysis of user conversations in on-line social media and their evolution over time. We propose a dynamic model that predicts the growth dynamics and structural properties of conversation threads. The model reconciles the differing observations that have been reported in existing studies. By separating artificial factors from user behavior, we show that there are actually underlying rules in common for on-line conversations in different social media websites. Results of our model are supported by empirical measurements throughout a number of different social media websites.",KDD
A Convolutional Approach for Misinformation Identification,2017,"The fast expanding of social media fuels the spreading of misinformation which disrupts people's normal lives. It is urgent to achieve goals of misinformation identification and early detection in social media. In dynamic and complicated social media scenarios, some conventional methods mainly concentrate on feature engineering which fail to cover potential features in new scenarios and have difficulty in shaping elaborate high-level interactions among significant features. Moreover, a recent Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based method suffers from deficiencies that it is not qualified for practical early detection of misinformation and poses a bias to the latest input. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Convolutional Approach for Misinformation Identification (CAMI) based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CAMI can flexibly extract key features scattered among an input sequence and shape high-level interactions among significant features, which help effectively identify misinformation and achieve practical early detection. Experiment results on two large-scale datasets validate the effectiveness of CAMI model on both misinformation identification and early detection tasks.",IJCAI
Community membership identification from small seed sets,2014,"In many applications we have a social network of people and would like to identify the members of an interesting but unlabeled group or community. We start with a small number of exemplar group members -- they may be followers of a political ideology or fans of a music genre -- and need to use those examples to discover the additional members. This problem gives rise to the seed expansion problem in community detection: given example community members, how can the social graph be used to predict the identities of remaining, hidden community members? In contrast with global community detection (graph partitioning or covering), seed expansion is best suited for identifying communities locally concentrated around nodes of interest. A growing body of work has used seed expansion as a scalable means of detecting overlapping communities. Yet despite growing interest in seed expansion, there are divergent approaches in the literature and there still isn't a systematic understanding of which approaches work best in different domains. Here we evaluate several variants and uncover subtle trade-offs between different approaches. We explore which properties of the seed set can improve performance, focusing on heuristics that one can control in practice. As a consequence of this systematic understanding we have found several opportunities for performance gains. We also consider an adaptive version in which requests are made for additional membership labels of particular nodes, such as one finds in field studies of social communities. This leads to interesting connections and contrasts with active learning and the trade-offs of exploration and exploitation. Finally, we explore topological properties of communities and seed sets that correlate with algorithm performance, and explain these empirical observations with theoretical ones. We evaluate our methods across multiple domains, using publicly available datasets with labeled, ground-truth communities.",KDD
Scalable Betweenness Centrality Maximization via Sampling,2016,"Betweenness centrality (BWC) is a fundamental centrality measure in social network analysis. Given a large-scale network, how can we find the most central nodes? This question is of great importance to many key applications that rely on BWC, including community detection and understanding graph vulnerability. Despite the large amount of work on scalable approximation algorithm design for BWC, estimating BWC on large-scale networks remains a computational challenge.
 In this paper, we study the Centrality Maximization problem (CMP): given a graph G = (V,E) and a positive integer k, find a set S* Ã¢Å â  V that maximizes BWC subject to the cardinality constraint |S*| Ã¢â°Â¤ k. We present an efficient randomized algorithm that provides a (1 -- 1/e -- ÃÂµ)-approximation with high probability, where ÃÂµ > 0. Our results improve the current state-of-the-art result [40]. Furthermore, we provide the first theoretical evidence for the validity of a crucial assumption in betweenness centrality estimation, namely that in real-world networks O(|V|2) shortest paths pass through the top-k central nodes, where k is a constant. This also explains why our algorithm runs in near linear time on real-world networks. We also show that our algorithm and analysis can be applied to a wider range of centrality measures, by providing a general analytical framework.
 On the experimental side, we perform an extensive experimental analysis of our method on real-world networks, demonstrate its accuracy and scalability, and study different properties of central nodes. Then, we compare the sampling method used by the state-of-the-art algorithm with our method. Furthermore, we perform a study of BWC in time evolving networks, and see how the centrality of the central nodes in the graphs changes over time. Finally, we compare the performance of the stochastic Kronecker model [28] to real data, and observe that it generates a similar growth pattern.",KDD
Seeing the Unseen Network: Inferring Hidden Social Ties from Respondent-Driven Sampling,2016,"Learning about the social structure of hidden and hard-to-reach populations Ã¢â¬â such as drug users and sex workers Ã¢â¬â is a major goal of epidemiological and public health research on risk behaviors and disease prevention. Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is a peer-referral process widely used by many health organizations, where research subjects recruit other subjects from their social network. In such surveys, researchers observe who recruited whom, along with the time of recruitment and the total number of acquaintances (network degree) of respondents. However, due to privacy concerns, the identities of acquaintances are not disclosed. In this work, we show how to reconstruct the underlying network structure through which the subjects are recruited. We formulate the dynamics of RDS as a continuous-time diffusion process over the underlying graph and derive the likelihood of the recruitment time series under an arbitrary inter-recruitment time distribution. We develop an efficient stochastic optimization algorithm called RENDER (REspoNdent-Driven nEtwork Reconstruction) that finds the network that best explains the collected data. We support our analytical results through an exhaustive set of experiments on both synthetic and real data.",AAAI
Optimal Control of Complex Systems through Variational Inference with a Discrete Event Decision Process (Page 296),2019,"Complex social systems are composed of interconnected individuals whose interactions result in group behaviors. Optimal control of a real-world complex system has many applications, including road traffic management, epidemic prevention, and information dissemination. However, such real-world complex system control is difficult to achieve because of high-dimensional and non-linear system dynamics, and the exploding state and action spaces for the decision maker. Prior methods can be divided into two categories: simulation-based and analytical approaches. Existing simulation approaches have high-variance in Monte Carlo integration, and the analytical approaches suffer from modeling inaccuracy. We adopted simulation modeling in specifying the complex dynamics of a complex system, and developed analytical solutions for searching optimal strategies in a complex network with high-dimensional state-action space. To capture the complex system dynamics, we formulate the complex social network decision making problem as a discrete event decision process. To address the curse of dimensionality and search in high-dimensional state action spaces in complex systems, we reduce control of a complex system to variational inference and parameter learning, introduce Bethe entropy approximation, and develop an expectation propagation algorithm. Our proposed algorithm leads to higher system expected rewards, faster convergence, and lower variance of value function in a real-world transportation scenario than state-of-the-art analytical and sampling approaches.",AAMAS
Power-law Distribution Aware Trust Prediction,2018,"Trust prediction, aiming to predict the trust relations between users in a social network, is a key to helping users discover the reliable information. Many trust prediction methods are proposed based on the low-rank assumption of a trust network. However, one typical property of the trust network is that the trust relations follow the power-law distribution, i.e., few users are trusted by many other users, while most tail users have few trustors. Due to these tail users, the fundamental low-rank assumption made by existing methods is seriously violated and becomes unrealistic. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method to address the problem of the violated low-rank assumption. Instead of discovering the low-rank component of the trust network alone, we learn a sparse component of the trust network to describe the tail users simultaneously. With both of the learned low-rank and sparse components, the trust relations in the whole network can be better captured. Moreover, the transitive closure structure of the trust relations is also integrated into our model. We then derive an effective iterative algorithm to infer the parameters of our model, along with the proof of correctness. Extensive experimental results on real-world trust networks demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method over the state-of-the-arts.",IJCAI
Collective graph identification,2011,"Data describing networks (communication networks, transaction networks, disease transmission networks, collaboration networks, etc.) is becoming increasingly ubiquitous. While this observational data is useful, it often only hints at the actual underlying social or technological structures which give rise to the interactions. For example, an email communication network provides useful insight but is not the same as the ""real"" social network among individuals. In this paper, we introduce the problem of graph identification, i.e., the discovery of the true graph structure underlying an observed network. We cast the problem as a probabilistic inference task, in which we must infer the nodes, edges, and node labels of a hidden graph, based on evidence provided by the observed network. This in turn corresponds to the problems of performing entity resolution, link prediction, and node labeling to infer the hidden graph. While each of these problems have been studied separately, they have never been considered together as a coherent task. We present a simple yet novel approach to address all three problems simultaneously. Our approach, called C3, consists of Coupled Collective Classifiers that are iteratively applied to propagate information among solutions to the problems. We empirically demonstrate that C3 is superior, in terms of both predictive accuracy and runtime, to state-of-the-art probabilistic approaches on three real-world problems.",KDD
A Framework for Minimal Clustering Modification via Constraint Programming,2017,"Consider the situation where your favorite clustering algorithm applied to a data set returns a good clustering but there are a few undesirable properties. One adhoc way to fix this is to re-run the clustering algorithm and hope to find a better variation. Instead, we propose to not run the algorithm again but minimally modify the existing clustering to remove the undesirable properties. We formulate the minimal clustering modification problem where we are given an initial clustering produced from any algorithm. The clustering is then modified to: i) remove the undesirable properties and ii) be minimally different to the given clustering. We show the underlying feasibility sub-problem can be intractable and demonstrate the flexibility of our constraint programming formulation. We empirically validate its usefulness through experiments on social network and medical imaging data sets.",AAAI
Finding Cut from the Same Cloth: Cross Network Link Recommendation via Joint Matrix Factorization,2017,"With the emergence of online forums associated with major diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, many patients are increasingly dependent on such disease-specific social networks to gain access to additional resources. Among these patients, it is common for them to stick to one disease-specific social network, although their desired resources might be spread over multiple social networks, such as patients with similar questions and concerns. Motivated by this application, in this paper, we focus on cross network link recommendation, which aims to identify similar users across multiple heterogeneous social networks. The problem setting is different from existing work on cross network link prediction, which either tries to link accounts of the same user from different social networks, or aims to match users with complementary expertise or interest. To approach the problem of cross network link recommendation, we propose to jointly decompose the user-keyword matrices from multiple social networks, while requiring them to share the same topics and user group-topic association matrices. This constraint comes from the fact that social networks dedicated to the same disease tend to share the same topics as well as the interests of users groups in certain topics. Based on this intuition, we construct a generic optimization framework, provide four instantiations and an iterative optimization algorithm with performance analysis. In the experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over state-of-the-art techniques on various real-world data sets.",AAAI
COSINE: Community-Preserving Social Network Embedding From Information Diffusion Cascades,2018,"This paper studies the problem of social network embedding without relying on network structures that are usually not observed in many cases. We address that the information diffusion process across networks naturally reflects rich proximity relationships between users. Meanwhile, social networks contain multiple communities regularizing communication pathways for information propagation. Based on the above observations, we propose a probabilistic generative model, called COSINE, to learn community-preserving social network embeddings from the recurrent and time-stamped social contagion logs, namely information diffusion cascades. The learned embeddings therefore capture the high-order user proximities in social networks. Leveraging COSINE, we are able to discover underlying social communities and predict temporal dynamics of social contagion. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our proposed model significantly outperforms the existing approaches.",AAAI
"Human mobility, social ties, and link prediction",2011,"Our understanding of how individual mobility patterns shape and impact the social network is limited, but is essential for a deeper understanding of network dynamics and evolution. This question is largely unexplored, partly due to the difficulty in obtaining large-scale society-wide data that simultaneously capture the dynamical information on individual movements and social interactions. Here we address this challenge for the first time by tracking the trajectories and communication records of 6 Million mobile phone users. We find that the similarity between two individuals' movements strongly correlates with their proximity in the social network. We further investigate how the predictive power hidden in such correlations can be exploited to address a challenging problem: which new links will develop in a social network. We show that mobility measures alone yield surprising predictive power, comparable to traditional network-based measures. Furthermore, the prediction accuracy can be significantly improved by learning a supervised classifier based on combined mobility and network measures. We believe our findings on the interplay of mobility patterns and social ties offer new perspectives on not only link prediction but also network dynamics.",KDD
The role of information diffusion in the evolution of social networks,2013,"Every day millions of users are connected through online social networks, generating a rich trove of data that allows us to study the mechanisms behind human interactions. Triadic closure has been treated as the major mechanism for creating social links: if Alice follows Bob and Bob follows Charlie, Alice will follow Charlie. Here we present an analysis of longitudinal micro-blogging data, revealing a more nuanced view of the strategies employed by users when expanding their social circles. While the network structure affects the spread of information among users, the network is in turn shaped by this communication activity. This suggests a link creation mechanism whereby Alice is more likely to follow Charlie after seeing many messages by Charlie. We characterize users with a set of parameters associated with different link creation strategies, estimated by a Maximum-Likelihood approach. Triadic closure does have a strong effect on link formation, but shortcuts based on traffic are another key factor in interpreting network evolution. However, individual strategies for following other users are highly heterogeneous. Link creation behaviors can be summarized by classifying users in different categories with distinct structural and behavioral characteristics. Users who are popular, active, and influential tend to create traffic-based shortcuts, making the information diffusion process more efficient in the network.",KDD
HySAD: a semi-supervised hybrid shilling attack detector for trustworthy product recommendation,2012,"Shilling attackers apply biased rating profiles to recommender systems for manipulating online product recommendations. Although many studies have been devoted to shilling attack detection, few of them can handle the hybrid shilling attacks that usually happen in practice, and the studies for real-life applications are rarely seen. Moreover, little attention has yet been paid to modeling both labeled and unlabeled user profiles, although there are often a few labeled but numerous unlabeled users available in practice. This paper presents a Hybrid Shilling Attack Detector, or HySAD for short, to tackle these problems. In particular, HySAD introduces MC-Relief to select effective detection metrics, and Semi-supervised Naive Bayes (SNB_lambda) to precisely separate Random-Filler model attackers and Average-Filler model attackers from normal users. Thorough experiments on MovieLens and Netflix datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HySAD in detecting hybrid shilling attacks, and its robustness for various obfuscated strategies. A real-life case study on product reviews of Amazon.cn is also provided, which further demonstrates that HySAD can effectively improve the accuracy of a collaborative-filtering based recommender system, and provide interesting opportunities for in-depth analysis of attacker behaviors. These, in turn, justify the value of HySAD for real-world applications.",KDD
From Truth Discovery to Trustworthy Opinion Discovery: An Uncertainty-Aware Quantitative Modeling Approach,2016,"In this era of information explosion, conflicts are often encountered when information is provided by multiple sources. Traditional truth discovery task aims to identify the truth the most trustworthy information, from conflicting sources in different scenarios. In this kind of tasks, truth is regarded as a fixed value or a set of fixed values. However, in a number of real-world cases, objective truth existence cannot be ensured and we can only identify single or multiple reliable facts from opinions. Different from traditional truth discovery task, we address this uncertainty and introduce the concept of trustworthy opinion of an entity, treat it as a random variable, and use its distribution to describe consistency or controversy, which is particularly difficult for data which can be numerically measured, i.e. quantitative information. In this study, we focus on the quantitative opinion, propose an uncertainty-aware approach called Kernel Density Estimation from Multiple Sources (KDEm) to estimate its probability distribution, and summarize trustworthy information based on this distribution. Experiments indicate that KDEm not only has outstanding performance on the classical numeric truth discovery task, but also shows good performance on multi-modality detection and anomaly detection in the uncertain-opinion setting.",KDD
TextTruth: An Unsupervised Approach to Discover Trustworthy Information from Multi-Sourced Text Data,2018,"Truth discovery has attracted increasingly more attention due to its ability to distill trustworthy information from noisy multi-sourced data without any supervision. However, most existing truth discovery methods are designed for structured data, and cannot meet the strong need to extract trustworthy information from raw text data as text data has its unique characteristics. The major challenges of inferring true information on text data stem from the multifactorial property of text answers (i.e., an answer may contain multiple key factors) and the diversity of word usages (i.e., different words may have the same semantic meaning). To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel truth discovery method, named ""TextTruth"", which jointly groups the keywords extracted from the answers of a specific question into multiple interpretable factors, and infers the trustworthiness of both answer factors and answer providers. After that, the answers to each question can be ranked based on the estimated trustworthiness of factors. The proposed method works in an unsupervised manner, and thus can be applied to various application scenarios that involve text data. Experiments on three real-world datasets show that the proposed TextTruth model can accurately select trustworthy answers, even when these answers are formed by multiple factors.",KDD
"Leveraging Propagation for Data Mining: Models, Algorithms and Applications",2016,"Can we infer if a user is sick from her tweet? How do opinions get formed in online forums? Which people should we immunize to prevent an epidemic as fast as possible? How do we quickly zoom out of a graph? Graphs---also known as networks---are powerful tools for modeling processes and situations of interest in real life domains of social systems, cyber-security, epidemiology, and biology. They are ubiquitous, from online social networks, gene-regulatory networks, to router graphs.
 This tutorial will cover recent and state-of-the-art research on how propagation-like processes can help big-data mining specifically involving large networks and time-series, algorithms behind network problems, and their practical applications in various diverse settings. Topics include diffusion and virus propagation in networks, anomaly and outbreak detection, event prediction and connections with work in public health, the web and online media, social sciences, humanities, and cyber-security.",KDD
Link Prediction with Personalized Social Influence,2018,"Link prediction in social networks is to infer the new links likely to be formed next or to reconstruct the links that are currently missing. Other than the pure topological network structures, social networks are often associated with rich information of social activities of users, such as tweeting, retweeting, and replying. Social theories such as social influence indicate that social activities could have potential impacts on the neighbors, and links in social media could be the results of the social influence among users. It motivates us to learn and model social influence among users to tackle the link prediction problem. However, this is a non-trivial task since it is challenging to model heterogeneous social activities. Traditional methods often define universal metrics of social influence for all users, but even for the same activity of a user, the influence towards different neighbors might not be the same. It motivates a personalized learning schema. In information theory, if a time-series signal influences another, then the uncertainty in the latter one will be reduced, given the distribution of the former one. Thus, we are motivated to learn social influence based on the timestamps of social activities. Given the timestamps of each user, we use entropy to measure the reduction of uncertainty of his/her neighbors. The learned social influence is then incorporated into a graph based link prediction model to perform joint learning. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed framework can perform better than the state-of-the-art methods on different real-world networks.",AAAI
Online Topic-based Social Influence Analysis for the Wimbledon Championships,2015,"Various industries are turning to social media to identify key influencers on topics of interest. Following this trend, the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club (AELTC) is keen to analyze the `social pulse' around the famous Wimbledon Championships. IBM developed and deployed social influence analysis capability for AELTC during the 2014 edition of the Championship. The design and implementation of influence analysis technology in the real world involves several challenges. In this paper, we define various functional and usability criteria that social influence scores should satisfy, and propose a multi-dimensional definition of influence that satisfies these criteria. We highlight the need to identify both all-time influencers and recent influencers, and track user influences over multiple time-scales for this purpose. We also stress the importance of aspect-specific influence analysis, and investigate an approach that uses an aspect hierarchy that annotates tweets with topics or aspects before analyzing them for influence. We also describe interesting insights discovered by our tool and the lessons that we learnt from this engagement.",KDD
Smoothing techniques for adaptive online language models: topic tracking in tweet streams,2011,"We are interested in the problem of tracking broad topics such as ""baseball"" and ""fashion"" in continuous streams of short texts, exemplified by tweets from the microblogging service Twitter. The task is conceived as a language modeling problem where per-topic models are trained using hashtags in the tweet stream, which serve as proxies for topic labels. Simple perplexity-based classifiers are then applied to filter the tweet stream for topics of interest. Within this framework, we evaluate, both intrinsically and extrinsically, smoothing techniques for integrating ""foreground"" models (to capture recency) and ""background"" models (to combat sparsity), as well as different techniques for retaining history. Experiments show that unigram language models smoothed using a normalized extension of stupid backoff and a simple queue for history retention performs well on the task.",KDD
Open domain event extraction from twitter,2012,"Tweets are the most up-to-date and inclusive stream of in- formation and commentary on current events, but they are also fragmented and noisy, motivating the need for systems that can extract, aggregate and categorize important events. Previous work on extracting structured representations of events has focused largely on newswire text; Twitter's unique characteristics present new challenges and opportunities for open-domain event extraction. This paper describes TwiCal-- the first open-domain event-extraction and categorization system for Twitter. We demonstrate that accurately extracting an open-domain calendar of significant events from Twitter is indeed feasible. In addition, we present a novel approach for discovering important event categories and classifying extracted events based on latent variable models. By leveraging large volumes of unlabeled data, our approach achieves a 14% increase in maximum F1 over a supervised baseline. A continuously updating demonstration of our system can be viewed at http://statuscalendar.com; Our NLP tools are available at http://github.com/aritter/ twitter_nlp.",KDD

MediaRank: Computational Ranking of Online News Sources,2019,"In the recent political climate, the topic of news quality has drawn attention both from the public and the academic communities. The growing distrust of traditional news media makes it harder to find a common base of accepted truth. In this work, we design and build MediaRank (urlwww.media-rank.com ), a fully automated system to rank over 50,000 online news sources around the world. MediaRank collects and analyzes one million news webpages and two million related tweets everyday. We base our algorithmic analysis on four properties journalists have established to be associated with reporting quality: peer reputation, reporting bias/breadth, bottomline financial pressure, and popularity. Our major contributions of this paper include: (i) Open, interpretable quality rankings for over 50,000 of the world's major news sources. Our rankings are validated against 35 published news rankings, including French, German, Russian, and Spanish language sources. MediaRank scores correlate positively with 34 of 35 of these expert rankings. (ii) New computational methods for measuring influence and bottomline pressure. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the large-scale news reporting citation graph in-depth. We also propose new ways to measure the aggressiveness of advertisements and identify social bots, establishing a connection between both types of bad behavior. (iii) Analyzing the effect of media source bias and significance. We prove that news sources cite others despite different political views in accord with quality measures. However, in four English-speaking countries (US, UK, Canada, and Australia), the highest ranking sources all disproportionately favor left-wing parties, even when the majority of news sources exhibited conservative slants.",KDD
Mining evidences for named entity disambiguation,2013,"Named entity disambiguation is the task of disambiguating named entity mentions in natural language text and link them to their corresponding entries in a knowledge base such as Wikipedia. Such disambiguation can help enhance readability and add semantics to plain text. It is also a central step in constructing high-quality information network or knowledge graph from unstructured text. Previous research has tackled this problem by making use of various textual and structural features from a knowledge base. Most of the proposed algorithms assume that a knowledge base can provide enough explicit and useful information to help disambiguate a mention to the right entity. However, the existing knowledge bases are rarely complete (likely will never be), thus leading to poor performance on short queries with not well-known contexts. In such cases, we need to collect additional evidences scattered in internal and external corpus to augment the knowledge bases and enhance their disambiguation power. In this work, we propose a generative model and an incremental algorithm to automatically mine useful evidences across documents. With a specific modeling of ""background topic"" and ""unknown entities"", our model is able to harvest useful evidences out of noisy information. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches significantly: boosting the disambiguation accuracy from 43% (baseline) to 86% on short queries derived from tweets.",KDD
ClusType: Effective Entity Recognition and Typing by Relation Phrase-Based Clustering,2015,"Entity recognition is an important but challenging research problem. In reality, many text collections are from specific, dynamic, or emerging domains, which poses significant new challenges for entity recognition with increase in name ambiguity and context sparsity, requiring entity detection without domain restriction. In this paper, we investigate entity recognition (ER) with distant-supervision and propose a novel relation phrase-based ER framework, called ClusType, that runs data-driven phrase mining to generate entity mention candidates and relation phrases, and enforces the principle that relation phrases should be softly clustered when propagating type information between their argument entities. Then we predict the type of each entity mention based on the type signatures of its co-occurring relation phrases and the type indicators of its surface name, as computed over the corpus. Specifically, we formulate a joint optimization problem for two tasks, type propagation with relation phrases and multi-view relation phrase clustering. Our experiments on multiple genres---news, Yelp reviews and tweets---demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of ClusType, with an average of 37% improvement in F1 score over the best compared method.",KDD
Beating the news' with EMBERS: forecasting civil unrest using open source indicators,2014,"We describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of EMBERS, an automated, 24x7 continuous system for forecasting civil unrest across 10 countries of Latin America using open source indicators such as tweets, news sources, blogs, economic indicators, and other data sources. Unlike retrospective studies, EMBERS has been making forecasts into the future since Nov 2012 which have been (and continue to be) evaluated by an independent T&E team (MITRE). Of note, EMBERS has successfully forecast the June 2013 protests in Brazil and Feb 2014 violent protests in Venezuela. We outline the system architecture of EMBERS, individual models that leverage specific data sources, and a fusion and suppression engine that supports trading off specific evaluation criteria. EMBERS also provides an audit trail interface that enables the investigation of why specific predictions were made along with the data utilized for forecasting. Through numerous evaluations, we demonstrate the superiority of EMBERS over baserate methods and its capability to forecast significant societal happenings.",KDD
Location-aware publish/subscribe,2013,"Location-based services have become widely available on mobile devices. Existing methods employ a pull model or user-initiated model, where a user issues a query to a server which replies with location-aware answers. To provide users with instant replies, a push model or server-initiated model is becoming an inevitable computing model in the next-generation location-based services. In the push model, subscribers register spatio-textual subscriptions to capture their interests, and publishers post spatio-textual messages. This calls for a high-performance location-aware publish/subscribe system to deliver publishers' messages to relevant subscribers.In this paper, we address the research challenges that arise in designing a location-aware publish/subscribe system. We propose an rtree based index structure by integrating textual descriptions into rtree nodes. We devise efficient filtering algorithms and develop effective pruning techniques to improve filtering efficiency. Experimental results show that our method achieves high performance. For example, our method can filter 500 tweets in a second for 10 million registered subscriptions on a commodity computer.",KDD
Discovery of significant emerging trends,2010,"We describe a system that monitors social and mainstream media to determine shifts in what people are thinking about a product or company.

Case studies show a good ability to rapidly pinpoint emerging subjects buried deep in large volumes of data and then highlight those that are rising or falling in significance as they relate to the firms interests.

Ranking Tweets by Labeled and Collaboratively Selected Pairs with Transitive Closure,2014,"Tweets ranking is important for information acquisition in Microblog. Due to the content sparsity and lackof labeled data, it is better to employ semi-supervisedlearning methods to utilize the unlabeled data. However,most of previous semi-supervised learning methods donot consider the pair conflict problem, which means thatthe new selected unlabeled data may conflict with the labeled and previously selected data. It will hurt the learning performance a lot, if the training data contains manyconflict pairs. In this paper, we propose a new collaborative semi-supervised SVM ranking model (CSR-TC)with consideration of the order conflict. The unlabeleddata is selected based on a dynamically maintained transitive closure graph to avoid pair conflict. We also investigate the two views of features, intrinsic and contentrelevant features, for the proposed model. Extensive experiments are conducted on TREC Microblogging corpus. The results demonstrate that our proposed methodachieves significant improvement, compared to severalstate-of-the-art models.",AAAI
Predicting Demographics of High-Resolution Geographies with Geotagged Tweets,2017,"In this paper, we consider the problem of predicting demographics of geographic units given geotagged Tweets that are composed within these units. Traditional survey methods that offer demographics estimates are usually limited in terms of geographic resolution, geographic boundaries, and time intervals. Thus, it would be highly useful to develop computational methods that can complement traditional survey methods by offering demographics estimates at finer geographic resolutions, with flexible geographic boundaries (i.e. not confined to administrative boundaries), and at different time intervals. While prior work has focused on predicting demographics and health statistics at relatively coarse geographic resolutions such as the county-level or state-level, we introduce an approach to predict demographics at finer geographic resolutions such as the blockgroup-level. For the task of predicting gender and race/ethnicity counts at the blockgroup-level, an approach adapted from prior work to our problem achieves an average correlation of 0.389 (gender) and 0.569 (race) on a held-out test dataset. Our approach outperforms this prior approach with an average correlation of 0.671 (gender) and 0.692 (race).",AAAI
"Collective Sensemaking via Social Sensors: Extracting, Profiling, Analyzing, and Predicting Real-world Events",2016,"Social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook have emerged as some of the most important platforms for people to discover, report, share, and communicate with others about various public events, be they of global or local interest (some high profile examples include the U.S Presidential debates, the Boston bombings, the hurricane Sandy, etc). The burst of social media reaction can be seen as a valuable real-time reflection of events as they happen, and can be used for a variety of applications such as computational journalism. Until now, such analysis has been mostly done manually or through primitive tools. Scalable and automated approaches are needed given the massive amounts of both event and reaction information. These approaches must also be able to conduct in-depth analysis of complex interactions between an event and its audience. Supporting such automation and examination however poses several computational challenges. In recent years, research communities have witnessed a growing interest in tackling these challenges. Furthermore, much recent research has begun to focus on solving more complex event analytics tasks such as post-event effect quantification and event progress prediction. This tutorial aims to review and examine current state of the research progress on this emerging topic.",KDD
Capacitated team formation problem on social networks,2012,"In a team formation problem, one is required to find a group of users that can match the requirements of a collaborative task. Example of such collaborative tasks abound, ranging from software product development to various participatory sensing tasks in knowledge creation. Due to the nature of the task, team members are often required to work on a co-operative basis. Previous studies [1, 2] have indicated that co-operation becomes effective in presence of social connections. Therefore, effective team selection requires the team members to be socially close as well as a division of the task among team members so that no user is overloaded by the assignment. In this work, we investigate how such teams can be formed on a social network.
 Since our team formation problems are proven to be NP-hard, we design efficient approximate algorithms for finding near optimum teams with provable guarantees. As traditional data-sets from on-line social networks (e.g. Twitter, Facebook etc) typically do not contain instances of large scale collaboration, we have crawled millions of software repositories spanning a period of four years and hundreds of thousands of developers from GitHub, a popular open-source social coding network. We perform large scale experiments on this data-set to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of our algorithms. Experimental results suggest that our algorithms achieve significant improvement in finding effective teams, as compared to naive strategies and scale well with the size of the data. Finally, we provide a validation of our techniques by comparing with existing software teams.",KDD
Leveraging Social Context for Modeling Topic Evolution,2015,"Topic discovery and evolution (TDE) has been a problem which has gained long standing interest in the research community. The goal in topic discovery is to identify groups of keywords from large corpora so that the information in those corpora are summarized succinctly. The nature of text corpora has changed dramatically in the past few years with the advent of social media. Social media services allow users to constantly share, follow and comment on posts from other users. Hence, such services have given a new dimension to the traditional text corpus. The new dimension being that today's corpora have a social context embedded in them in terms of the community of users interested in a particular post, their profiles etc. We wish to harness this social context that comes along with the textual content for TDE. In particular, our goal is to both qualitatively and quantitatively analyze when social context actually helps with TDE. Methodologically, we approach the problem of TDE by a proposing non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) based model that incorporates both the textual information and social context information. We perform experiments on large scale real world dataset of news articles, and use Twitter as the platform providing information about the social context of these news articles. We compare with and outperform several state-of-the-art baselines. Our conclusion is that using the social context information is most useful when faced with topics that are particularly difficult to detect.",KDD
Community discovery and profiling with social messages,2012,"Discovering communities from social media and collaboration systems has been of great interest in recent years. Existing work show prospects of modeling contents and social links, aiming at discovering social communities, whose definition varies by application. We believe that a community depends not only on the group of people who actively participate, but also the topics they communicate about or collaborate on. This is especially true for workplace email communications. Within an organization, it is not uncommon that employees multifunction, and groups of employees collaborate on multiple projects at the same time. In this paper, we aim to automatically discovering and profiling users' communities by taking into account both the contacts and the topics. More specifically, we propose a community profiling model called COCOMP, where the communities labels are latent, and each social document corresponds to an information sharing activity among the most probable community members regarding the most relevant community issues. Experiment results on several social communication datasets, including emails and Twitter messages, demonstrate that the model can discover users' communities effectively, and provide concrete semantics.",KDD
Engagement Capacity and Engaging Team Formation for Reach Maximization of Online Social Media Platforms,2016,"The challenges of assessing the ""health"" of online social media platforms and strategically growing them are recognized by many practitioners and researchers. For those platforms that primarily rely on user-generated content, the reach -- the degree of participation referring to the percentage and involvement of users -- is a key indicator of success. This paper lays a theoretical foundation for measuring engagement as a driver of reach that achieves growth via positive externality effects. The paper takes a game theoretic approach to quantifying engagement, viewing a platform's social capital as a cooperatively created value and finding a fair distribution of this value among the contributors. It introduces engagement capacity, a measure of the ability of users and user groups to engage peers, and formulates the Engaging Team Formation Problem (EngTFP) to identify the sets of users that ""make a platform go"". We show how engagement capacity can be useful in characterizing forum user behavior and in the reach maximization efforts. We also stress how engagement analysis differs from influence measurement. Computational investigations with Twitter and Health Forum data reveal the properties of engagement capacity and the utility of EngTFP.",KDD
Multi-Task Learning for Spatio-Temporal Event Forecasting,2015,"Spatial event forecasting from social media is an important problem but encounters critical challenges, such as dynamic patterns of features (keywords) and geographic heterogeneity (e.g., spatial correlations, imbalanced samples, and different populations in different locations). Most existing approaches (e.g., LASSO regression, dynamic query expansion, and burst detection) are designed to address some of these challenges, but not all of them. This paper proposes a novel multi-task learning framework which aims to concurrently address all the challenges. Specifically, given a collection of locations (e.g., cities), we propose to build forecasting models for all locations simultaneously by extracting and utilizing appropriate shared information that effectively increases the sample size for each location, thus improving the forecasting performance. We combine both static features derived from a predefined vocabulary by domain experts and dynamic features generated from dynamic query expansion in a multi-task feature learning framework; we investigate different strategies to balance homogeneity and diversity between static and dynamic terms. Efficient algorithms based on Iterative Group Hard Thresholding are developed to achieve efficient and effective model training and prediction. Extensive experimental evaluations on Twitter data from four different countries in Latin America demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed approach.",KDD
EANN: Event Adversarial Neural Networks for Multi-Modal Fake News Detection,2018,"As news reading on social media becomes more and more popular, fake news becomes a major issue concerning the public and government. The fake news can take advantage of multimedia content to mislead readers and get dissemination, which can cause negative effects or even manipulate the public events. One of the unique challenges for fake news detection on social media is how to identify fake news on newly emerged events. Unfortunately, most of the existing approaches can hardly handle this challenge, since they tend to learn event-specific features that can not be transferred to unseen events. In order to address this issue, we propose an end-to-end framework named Event Adversarial Neural Network (EANN), which can derive event-invariant features and thus benefit the detection of fake news on newly arrived events. It consists of three main components: the multi-modal feature extractor, the fake news detector, and the event discriminator. The multi-modal feature extractor is responsible for extracting the textual and visual features from posts. It cooperates with the fake news detector to learn the discriminable representation for the detection of fake news. The role of event discriminator is to remove the event-specific features and keep shared features among events. Extensive experiments are conducted on multimedia datasets collected from Weibo and Twitter. The experimental results show our proposed EANN model can outperform the state-of-the-art methods, and learn transferable feature representations.",KDD

Non-parametric scan statistics for event detection and forecasting in heterogeneous social media graphs,2014,"Event detection in social media is an important but challenging problem. Most existing approaches are based on burst detection, topic modeling, or clustering techniques, which cannot naturally model the implicit heterogeneous network structure in social media. As a result, only limited information, such as terms and geographic locations, can be used. This paper presents Non-Parametric Heterogeneous Graph Scan (NPHGS), a new approach that considers the entire heterogeneous network for event detection: we first model the network as a ""sensor"" network, in which each node senses its ""neighborhood environment"" and reports an empirical p-value measuring its current level of anomalousness for each time interval (e.g., hour or day). Then, we efficiently maximize a nonparametric scan statistic over connected subgraphs to identify the most anomalous network clusters. Finally, the event represented by each cluster is summarized with information such as type of event, geographical locations, time, and participants. As a case study, we consider two applications using Twitter data, civil unrest event detection and rare disease outbreak detection, and present empirical evaluations illustrating the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach.",KDD
PET: a statistical model for popular events tracking in social communities,2010,"User generated information in online communities has been characterized with the mixture of a text stream and a network structure both changing over time. A good example is a web-blogging community with the daily blog posts and a social network of bloggers.
 An important task of analyzing an online community is to observe and track the popular events, or topics that evolve over time in the community. Existing approaches usually focus on either the burstiness of topics or the evolution of networks, but ignoring the interplay between textual topics and network structures.
 In this paper, we formally define the problem of popular event tracking in online communities (PET), focusing on the interplay between texts and networks. We propose a novel statistical method that models the the popularity of events over time, taking into consideration the burstiness of user interest, information diffusion on the network structure, and the evolution of textual topics. Specifically, a Gibbs Random Field is defined to model the influence of historic status and the dependency relationships in the graph; thereafter a topic model generates the words in text content of the event, regularized by the Gibbs Random Field. We prove that two classic models in information diffusion and text burstiness are special cases of our model under certain situations. Empirical experiments with two different communities and datasets (i.e., Twitter and DBLP) show that our approach is effective and outperforms existing approaches.",KDD
Event detection in activity networks,2014,"With the fast growth of smart devices and social networks, a lot of computing systems collect data that record different types of activities. An important computational challenge is to analyze these data, extract patterns, and understand activity trends. We consider the problem of mining activity networks to identify interesting events, such as a big concert or a demonstration in a city, or a trending keyword in a user community in a social network.
 We define an event to be a subset of nodes in the network that are close to each other and have high activity levels. We formalize the problem of event detection using two graph-theoretic formulations. The first one captures the compactness of an event using the sum of distances among all pairs of the event nodes. We show that this formulation can be mapped to the maxcut problem, and thus, it can be solved by applying standard semidefinite programming techniques. The second formulation captures compactness using a minimum-distance tree. This formulation leads to the prize-collecting Steiner-tree problem, which we solve by adapting existing approximation algorithms. For the two problems we introduce, we also propose efficient and effective greedy approaches and we prove performance guarantees for one of them. We experiment with the proposed algorithms on real datasets from a public bicycling system and a geolocation-enabled social network dataset collected from twitter. The results show that our methods are able to detect meaningful events.",KDD
SEISMIC: A Self-Exciting Point Process Model for Predicting Tweet Popularity,2015,"Social networking websites allow users to create and share content. Big information cascades of post resharing can form as users of these sites reshare others' posts with their friends and followers. One of the central challenges in understanding such cascading behaviors is in forecasting information outbreaks, where a single post becomes widely popular by being reshared by many users. In this paper, we focus on predicting the final number of reshares of a given post. We build on the theory of self-exciting point processes to develop a statistical model that allows us to make accurate predictions. Our model requires no training or expensive feature engineering. It results in a simple and efficiently computable formula that allows us to answer questions, in real-time, such as: Given a post's resharing history so far, what is our current estimate of its final number of reshares? Is the post resharing cascade past the initial stage of explosive growth? And, which posts will be the most reshared in the future?
 We validate our model using one month of complete Twitter data and demonstrate a strong improvement in predictive accuracy over existing approaches. Our model gives only 15% relative error in predicting final size of an average information cascade after observing it for just one hour.",KDD
FRAUDAR: Bounding Graph Fraud in the Face of Camouflage,2016,"Given a bipartite graph of users and the products that they review, or followers and followees, how can we detect fake reviews or follows? Existing fraud detection methods (spectral, etc.) try to identify dense subgraphs of nodes that are sparsely connected to the remaining graph. Fraudsters can evade these methods using camouflage, by adding reviews or follows with honest targets so that they look ""normal"". Even worse, some fraudsters use hijacked accounts from honest users, and then the camouflage is indeed organic. Our focus is to spot fraudsters in the presence of camouflage or hijacked accounts. We propose FRAUDAR, an algorithm that (a) is camouflage-resistant, (b) provides upper bounds on the effectiveness of fraudsters, and (c) is effective in real-world data. Experimental results under various attacks show that FRAUDAR outperforms the top competitor in accuracy of detecting both camouflaged and non-camouflaged fraud. Additionally, in real-world experiments with a Twitter follower-followee graph of 1.47 billion edges, FRAUDAR successfully detected a subgraph of more than 4000 detected accounts, of which a majority had tweets showing that they used follower-buying services.",KDD
STRIP: stream learning of influence probabilities,2013,"Influence-driven diffusion of information is a fundamental process in social networks. Learning the latent variables of such process, i.e., the influence strength along each link, is a central question towards understanding the structure and function of complex networks, modeling information cascades, and developing applications such as viral marketing.
 Motivated by modern microblogging platforms, such as twitter, in this paper we study the problem of learning influence probabilities in a data-stream scenario, in which the network topology is relatively stable and the challenge of a learning algorithm is to keep up with a continuous stream of tweets using a small amount of time and memory. Our contribution is a number of randomized approximation algorithms, categorized according to the available space (superlinear, linear, and sublinear in the number of nodes n) and according to different models (landmark and sliding window). Among several results, we show that we can learn influence probabilities with one pass over the data, using O(nlog n) space, in both the landmark model and the sliding-window model, and we further show that our algorithm is within a logarithmic factor of optimal.
 For truly large graphs, when one needs to operate with sublinear space, we show that we can still learn influence probabilities in one pass, assuming that we restrict our attention to the most active users.
 Our thorough experimental evaluation on large social graph demonstrates that the empirical performance of our algorithms agrees with that predicted by the theory.",KDD
Smart Broadcasting: Do You Want to be Seen?,2016,"Many users in online social networks are constantly trying to gain attention from their followers by broadcasting posts to them. These broadcasters are likely to gain greater attention if their posts can remain visible for a longer period of time among their followers' most recent feeds. Then when to post? In this paper, we study the problem of smart broadcasting using the framework of temporal point processes, where we model users feeds and posts as discrete events occurring in continuous time. Based on such continuous-time model, then choosing a broadcasting strategy for a user becomes a problem of designing the conditional intensity of her posting events. We derive a novel formula which links this conditional intensity with the visibility of the user in her followers' feeds. Furthermore, by exploiting this formula, we develop an efficient convex optimization framework for the when-to-post problem. Our method can find broadcasting strategies that reach a desired visibility level with provable guarantees. We experimented with data gathered from Twitter, and show that our framework can consistently make broadcasters' post more visible than alternatives.",KDD
Meta-path based multi-network collective link prediction,2014,"Online social networks offering various services have become ubiquitous in our daily life. Meanwhile, users nowadays are usually involved in multiple online social networks simultaneously to enjoy specific services provided by different networks. Formally, social networks that share some common users are named as partially aligned networks. In this paper, we want to predict the formation of social links in multiple partially aligned social networks at the same time, which is formally defined as the multi-network link (formation) prediction problem. In multiple partially aligned social networks, users can be extensively correlated with each other by various connections. To categorize these diverse connections among users, 7 ""intra-network social meta paths"" and 4 categories of ""inter-network social meta paths"" are proposed in this paper. These ""social meta paths"" can cover a wide variety of connection information in the network, some of which can be helpful for solving the multi-network link prediction problem but some can be not. To utilize useful connection, a subset of the most informative ""social meta paths"" are picked, the process of which is formally defined as ""social meta path selection"" in this paper. An effective general link formation prediction framework, Mli (Multi-network Link Identifier), is proposed in this paper to solve the multi-network link (formation) prediction problem. Built with heterogenous topological features extracted based on the selected ""social meta paths"" in the multiple partially aligned social networks, Mli can help refine and disambiguate the prediction results reciprocally in all aligned networks. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world partially aligned heterogeneous networks, Foursquare and Twitter, demonstrate that Mli can solve the multi-network link prediction problem very well.",KDD
Diversity maximization under matroid constraints,2013,"Aggregator websites typically present documents in the form of representative clusters. In order for users to get a broader perspective, it is important to deliver a diversified set of representative documents in those clusters. One approach to diversification is to maximize the average dissimilarity among documents. Another way to capture diversity is to avoid showing several documents from the same category (e.g. from the same news channel). We combine the above two diversification concepts by modeling the latter approach as a (partition) matroid constraint, and study diversity maximization problems under matroid constraints. We present the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for this problem, using a new technique. Our local search 0.5-approximation algorithm is also the first constant-factor approximation for the max-dispersion problem under matroid constraints. Our combinatorial proof technique for maximizing diversity under matroid constraints uses the existence of a family of Latin squares which may also be of independent interest.
 In order to apply these diversity maximization algorithms in the context of aggregator websites and as a preprocessing step for our diversity maximization tool, we develop greedy clustering algorithms that maximize weighted coverage of a predefined set of topics. Our algorithms are based on computing a set of cluster centers, where clusters are formed around them. We show the better performance of our algorithms for diversity and coverage maximization by running experiments on real (Twitter) and synthetic data in the context of real-time search over micro-posts. Finally we perform a user study validating our algorithms and diversity metrics.",KDD
Inferring social roles and statuses in social networks,2013,"Users in online social networks play a variety of social roles and statuses. For example, users in Twitter can be represented as advertiser, content contributor, information receiver, etc; users in Linkedin can be in different professional roles, such as engineer, salesperson and recruiter. Previous research work mainly focuses on using categorical and textual information to predict the attributes of users. However, it cannot be applied to a large number of users in real social networks, since much of such information is missing, outdated and non-standard. In this paper, we investigate the social roles and statuses that people act in online social networks in the perspective of network structures, since the uniqueness of social networks is connecting people. We quantitatively analyze a number of key social principles and theories that correlate with social roles and statuses. We systematically study how the network characteristics reflect the social situations of users in an online society. We discover patterns of homophily, the tendency of users to connect with users with similar social roles and statuses. In addition, we observe that different factors in social theories influence the social role/status of an individual user to various extent, since these social principles represent different aspects of the network. We then introduce an optimization framework based on Factor Conditioning Symmetry, and we propose a probabilistic model to integrate the optimization framework on local structural information as well as network influence to infer the unknown social roles and statuses of online users. We will present experiment results to show the effectiveness of the inference.",KDD
Rise and fall patterns of information diffusion: model and implications,2012,"The recent explosion in the adoption of search engines and new media such as blogs and Twitter have facilitated faster propagation of news and rumors. How quickly does a piece of news spread over these media? How does its popularity diminish over time? Does the rising and falling pattern follow a simple universal law?
 In this paper, we propose SpikeM, a concise yet flexible analytical model for the rise and fall patterns of influence propagation. Our model has the following advantages: (a) unification power: it generalizes and explains earlier theoretical models and empirical observations; (b) practicality: it matches the observed behavior of diverse sets of real data; (c) parsimony: it requires only a handful of parameters; and (d) usefulness: it enables further analytics tasks such as fore- casting, spotting anomalies, and interpretation by reverse- engineering the system parameters of interest (e.g. quality of news, count of interested bloggers, etc.).
 Using SpikeM, we analyzed 7.2GB of real data, most of which were collected from the public domain. We have shown that our SpikeM model accurately and succinctly describes all the patterns of the rise-and-fall spikes in these real datasets.",KDD
Finding trendsetters in information networks,2012,"Influential people have an important role in the process of information diffusion. However, there are several ways to be influential, for example, to be the most popular or the first that adopts a new idea. In this paper we present a methodology to find trendsetters in information networks according to a specific topic of interest. Trendsetters are people that adopt and spread new ideas influencing other people before these ideas become popular. At the same time, not all early adopters are trendsetters because only few of them have the ability of propagating their ideas by their social contacts through word-of-mouth. Differently from other influence measures, a trendsetter is not necessarily popular or famous, but the one whose ideas spread over the graph successfully. Other metrics such as node in-degree or even standard Pagerank focus only in the static topology of the network. We propose a ranking strategy that focuses on the ability of some users to push new ideas that will be successful in the future. To that end, we combine temporal attributes of nodes and edges of the network with a Pagerank based algorithm to find the trendsetters for a given topic. To test our algorithm we conduct innovative experiments over a large Twitter dataset. We show that nodes with high in-degree tend to arrive late for new trends, while users in the top of our ranking tend to be early adopters that also influence their social contacts to adopt the new trend.",KDD
Dynamics of conversations,2010,"How do online conversations build? Is there a common model that human communication follows? In this work we explore these questions in detail. We analyze the structure of conversations in three different social datasets, namely, Usenet groups, Yahoo! Groups, and Twitter. We propose a simple mathematical model for the generation of basic conversation structures and then refine this model to take into account the identities of each member of the conversation.",KDD
When-To-Post on Social Networks,2015,"For many users on social networks, one of the goals when broadcasting content is to reach a large audience. The probability of receiving reactions to a message differs for each user and depends on various factors, such as location, daily and weekly behavior patterns and the visibility of the message. While previous work has focused on overall network dynamics and message flow cascades, the problem of recommending personalized posting times has remained an under-explored topic of research.
 In this study, we formulate a when-to-post problem, where the objective is to find the best times for a user to post on social networks in order to maximize the probability of audience responses. To understand the complexity of the problem, we examine user behavior in terms of post-to-reaction times, and compare cross-network and cross-city weekly reaction behavior for users in different cities, on both Twitter and Facebook. We perform this analysis on over a billion posted messages and observed reactions, and propose multiple approaches for generating personalized posting schedules. We empirically assess these schedules on a sampled user set of 0.5 million active users and more than 25 million messages observed over a 56 day period. We show that users see a reaction gain of up to 17% on Facebook and 4% on Twitter when the recommended posting times are used.
 We open the dataset used in this study, which includes timestamps for over 144 million posts and over 1.1 billion reactions. The personalized schedules derived here are used in a fully deployed production system to recommend posting times for millions of users every day.",KDD
Social media data analysis for revealing collective behaviors,2012,"Along with the development of Web 2.0 applications, social media services has attracted many users and become their hands-on toolkits for recording life, sharing ideas, and social networking. Though social media services are essentially web or mobile applications and services, they combine user-generated content and social networks together, so that information can be created, transmitted, transformed, and consumed in the cyberspace. Thus, social media somehow could be regarded as a kind of sensor to the real life of its users. In general, the data from social media is of low quality. Pieces of information in social media are usually short, with informal presentation, and in some specific context that is highly related to the physical world. Therefore, it is challenging to extract semantics from social media data. However, we argue that given sufficient social media data, users' collective behaviors could be sensed, studied, and even predicted in a certain circumstance. Our study is conducted on data from two services, i.e. Twitter, and Sina Weibo, the most popular microblogging services all over the world and in China, respectively. Collective behaviors are actions of a large amount of various people, which are neither conforming nor deviant. Various collective behaviors are studied in the context of social media. Our studies show that there are various information flow patterns in social media, some of which are similar to traditional media such as newspapers, while others are embedded deep in the social network structure. The evolution of hotspots is highly affected by external stimulation, the social network structure, and individual user's activities. Furthermore, social media tends to be immune to some repeated similar external stimulations. Last but not the least, there is considerable difference in users' behavior between Twitter and Sina Weibo.",KDD
RSC: Mining and Modeling Temporal Activity in Social Media,2015,"Can we identify patterns of temporal activities caused by human communications in social media? Is it possible to model these patterns and tell if a user is a human or a bot based only on the timing of their postings? Social media services allow users to make postings, generating large datasets of human activity time-stamps. In this paper we analyze time-stamp data from social media services and find that the distribution of postings inter-arrival times (IAT) is characterized by four patterns: (i) positive correlation between consecutive IATs, (ii) heavy tails, (iii) periodic spikes and (iv) bimodal distribution. Based on our findings, we propose Rest-Sleep-and-Comment (RSC), a generative model that is able to match all four discovered patterns. We demonstrate the utility of RSC by showing that it can accurately fit real time-stamp data from Reddit and Twitter. We also show that RSC can be used to spot outliers and detect users with non-human behavior, such as bots. We validate RSC using real data consisting of over 35 million postings from Twitter and Reddit. RSC consistently provides a better fit to real data and clearly outperform existing models for human dynamics. RSC was also able to detect bots with a precision higher than 94%.",KDD
Representing documents through their readers,2013,"From Twitter to Facebook to Reddit, users have become accustomed to sharing the articles they read with friends or followers on their social networks. While previous work has modeled what these shared stories say about the user who shares them, the converse question remains unexplored: what can we learn about an article from the identities of its likely readers? To address this question, we model the content of news articles and blog posts by attributes of the people who are likely to share them. For example, many Twitter users describe themselves in a short profile, labeling themselves with phrases such as ""vegetarian"" or ""liberal."" By assuming that a user's labels correspond to topics in the articles he shares, we can learn a labeled dictionary from a training corpus of articles shared on Twitter. Thereafter, we can code any new document as a sparse non-negative linear combination of user labels, where we encourage correlated labels to appear together in the output via a structured sparsity penalty.
 Finally, we show that our approach yields a novel document representation that can be effectively used in many problem settings, from recommendation to modeling news dynamics. For example, while the top politics stories will change drastically from one month to the next, the ""politics"" label will still be there to describe them. We evaluate our model on millions of tweeted news articles and blog posts collected between September 2010 and September 2012, demonstrating that our approach is effective.",KDD
Information diffusion and external influence in networks,2012,"Social networks play a fundamental role in the diffusion of information. However, there are two different ways of how information reaches a person in a network. Information reaches us through connections in our social networks, as well as through the influence external out-of-network sources, like the mainstream media. While most present models of information adoption in networks assume information only passes from a node to node via the edges of the underlying network, the recent availability of massive online social media data allows us to study this process in more detail.
 We present a model in which information can reach a node via the links of the social network or through the influence of external sources. We then develop an efficient model parameter fitting technique and apply the model to the emergence of URL mentions in the Twitter network. Using a complete one month trace of Twitter we study how information reaches the nodes of the network. We quantify the external influences over time and describe how these influences affect the information adoption. We discover that the information tends to ""jump"" across the network, which can only be explained as an effect of an unobservable external influence on the network. We find that only about 71% of the information volume in Twitter can be attributed to network diffusion, and the remaining 29% is due to external events and factors outside the network.",KDD
CatchSync: catching synchronized behavior in large directed graphs,2014,"Given a directed graph of millions of nodes, how can we automatically spot anomalous, suspicious nodes, judging only from their connectivity patterns? Suspicious graph patterns show up in many applications, from Twitter users who buy fake followers, manipulating the social network, to botnet members performing distributed denial of service attacks, disturbing the network traffic graph. We propose a fast and effective method, CatchSync, which exploits two of the tell-tale signs left in graphs by fraudsters: (a) synchronized behavior: suspicious nodes have extremely similar behavior pattern, because they are often required to perform some task together (such as follow the same user); and (b) rare behavior: their connectivity patterns are very different from the majority. We introduce novel measures to quantify both concepts (""synchronicity"" and ""normality"") and we propose a parameter-free algorithm that works on the resulting synchronicity-normality plots. Thanks to careful design, CatchSync has the following desirable properties: (a) it is scalable to large datasets, being linear on the graph size; (b) it is parameter free; and (c) it is side-information-oblivious: it can operate using only the topology, without needing labeled data, nor timing information, etc., while still capable of using side information, if available. We applied CatchSync on two large, real datasets 1-billion-edge Twitter social graph and 3-billion-edge Tencent Weibo social graph, and several synthetic ones; CatchSync consistently outperforms existing competitors, both in detection accuracy by 36% on Twitter and 20% on Tencent Weibo, as well as in speed.",KDD
Compass: Spatio Temporal Sentiment Analysis of US Election What Twitter Says!,2017,"With the widespread growth of various social network tools and platforms, analyzing and understanding societal response and crowd reaction to important and emerging social issues and events through social media data is increasingly an important problem. However, there are numerous challenges towards realizing this goal effectively and efficiently, due to the unstructured and noisy nature of social media data. The large volume of the underlying data also presents a fundamental challenge. Furthermore, in many application scenarios, it is often interesting, and in some cases critical, to discover patterns and trends based on geographical and/or temporal partitions, and keep track of how they will change overtime.
 This brings up the interesting problem of spatio-temporal sentiment analysis from large-scale social media data. This paper investigates this problem through a data science project called ""US Election 2016, What Twitter Says"". The objective is to discover sentiment on Twitter towards either the democratic or the republican party at US county and state levels over any arbitrary temporal intervals, using a large collection of geotagged tweets from a period of 6 months leading up to the US Presidential Election in 2016. Our results demonstrate that by integrating and developing a combination of machine learning and data management techniques, it ispossible to do this at scale with effective outcomes. The results of our project have the potential to be adapted towards solving and influencing other interesting social issues such as building neighborhood happiness and health indicators.",KDD
Real-time Event Detection on Social Data Streams,2019,"Social networks are quickly becoming the primary medium for discussing what is happening around real-world events. The information that is generated on social platforms like Twitter can produce rich data streams for immediate insights into ongoing matters and the conversations around them. To tackle the problem of event detection, we model events as a list of clusters of trending entities over time. We describe a real-time system for discovering events that is modular in design and novel in scale and speed: it applies clustering on a large stream with millions of entities per minute and produces a dynamically updated set of events. In order to assess clustering methodologies, we build an evaluation dataset derived from a snapshot of the full Twitter Firehose and propose novel metrics for measuring clustering quality. Through experiments and system profiling, we highlight key results from the offline and online pipelines. Finally, we visualize a high profile event on Twitter to show the importance of modeling the evolution of events, especially those detected from social data streams.",KDD
Portraying Collective Spatial Attention in Twitter,2015,"Microblogging platforms such as Twitter have been recently frequently used for detecting real-time events. The spatial component, as reflected by user location, usually plays a key role in such systems. However, an often neglected source of spatial information are location mentions expressed in tweet contents. In this paper we demonstrate a novel visualization system for analyzing how Twitter users collectively talk about space and for uncovering correlations between geographical locations of Twitter users and the locations they tweet about. Our exploratory analysis is based on the development of a model of spatial information extraction and representation that allows building effective visual analytics framework for large scale datasets. We show visualization results based on half a year long dataset of Japanese tweets and a four months long collection of tweets from USA. The proposed system allows observing many space related aspects of tweet messages including the average scope of spatial attention of social media users and variances in spatial interest over time. The analytical framework we provide and the findings we outline can be valuable for scientists from diverse research areas and for any users interested in geographical and social aspects of shared online data.",KDD
One theme in all views: modeling consensus topics in multiple contexts,2013,"New challenges have been presented to classical topic models when applied to social media, as user-generated content suffers from significant problems of data sparseness. A variety of heuristic adjustments to these models have been proposed, many of which are based on the use of context information to improve the performance of topic modeling. Existing contextualized topic models rely on arbitrary manipulation of the model structure, by incorporating various context variables into the generative process of classical topic models in an ad hoc manner. Such manipulations usually result in much more complicated model structures, sophisticated inference procedures, and low generalizability to accommodate arbitrary types or combinations of contexts. In this paper we explore a different direction. We propose a general solution that is able to exploit multiple types of contexts without arbitrary manipulation of the structure of classical topic models. We formulate different types of contexts as multiple views of the partition of the corpus. A co-regularization framework is proposed to let these views collaborate with each other, vote for the consensus topics, and distinguish them from view-specific topics. Experiments with real-world datasets prove that the proposed method is both effective and flexible to handle arbitrary types of contexts.",KDD
DEMON: a local-first discovery method for overlapping communities,2012,"Community discovery in complex networks is an interesting problem with a number of applications, especially in the knowledge extraction task in social and information networks. However, many large networks often lack a particular community organization at a global level. In these cases, traditional graph partitioning algorithms fail to let the latent knowledge embedded in modular structure emerge, because they impose a top-down global view of a network. We propose here a simple local-first approach to community discovery, able to unveil the modular organization of real complex networks. This is achieved by democratically letting each node vote for the communities it sees surrounding it in its limited view of the global system, i.e. its ego neighborhood, using a label propagation algorithm; finally, the local communities are merged into a global collection. We tested this intuition against the state-of-the-art overlapping and non-overlapping community discovery methods, and found that our new method clearly outperforms the others in the quality of the obtained communities, evaluated by using the extracted communities to predict the metadata about the nodes of several real world networks. We also show how our method is deterministic, fully incremental, and has a limited time complexity, so that it can be used on web-scale real networks.",KDD
Political Tweets and Mainstream News Impact in India: A Mixed Methods Investigation into Political Outreach,2018,"Citizens' perception of politicians and political issues is increasingly influenced by social media. However, little is known about the potential of second order effects of social media in parts of the world where the majority of voting citizens are not online. In this paper, we examine whether a politician can move to communicating through social media as their primary means of outreach, and still present their message to the mainstream population through traditional media. By studying of the use of Twitter by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi between 2009 and 2015, the second-most followed elected official in the world, we present evidence of the impact of social media on print news. We use computational text mining techniques to automatically identify print news reports that use Modi's tweets as a source, alongside manual qualitative coding of tweets to analyze the role of tweet themes in print news coverage. We conclude that while Modi's social media messaging does get coverage in the print news, it is his more ""newsworthy"" tweets, such as references to celebrities, other politicians, or major events such as holidays that have a greater likelihood of coverage.",COMPASS
Thwarting Vote Buying Through Decoy Ballots,2017,"There is increasing interest in promoting participatory democracy, in particular by allowing voting by mail or internet and through random-sample elections. A pernicious concern, though, is that of vote buying, which occurs when a bad actor seeks to buy ballots, paying someone to vote against their own intent.This becomes possible whenever a voter is able to sell evidence of which way she voted. We show how to thwart vote buying through decoy ballots, which are not counted but are indistinguishable from real ballots to a buyer. We show that an Election Authority can significantly reduce the power of vote buying through a small number of optimally distributed decoys, and model societal processes by which decoys could be distributed.",IJCAI
User reputation in a comment rating environment,2011,"Reputable users are valuable assets of a web site. We focus on user reputation in a comment rating environment, where users make comments about content items and rate the comments of one another. Intuitively, a reputable user posts high quality comments and is highly rated by the user community. To our surprise, we find that the quality of a comment judged editorially is almost uncorrelated with the ratings that it receives, but can be predicted using standard text features, achieving accuracy as high as the agreement between two editors! However, extracting a pure reputation signal from ratings is difficult because of data sparseness and several confounding factors in users' voting behavior. To address these issues, we propose a novel bias-smoothed tensor model and empirically show that our model significantly outperforms a number of alternatives based on Yahoo! News, Yahoo! Buzz and Epinions datasets.",KDD
Discovering value from community activity on focused question answering sites: a case study of stack overflow,2012,"Question answering (Q&A) websites are now large repositories of valuable knowledge. While most Q&A sites were initially aimed at providing useful answers to the question asker, there has been a marked shift towards question answering as a community-driven knowledge creation process whose end product can be of enduring value to a broad audience. As part of this shift, specific expertise and deep knowledge of the subject at hand have become increasingly important, and many Q&A sites employ voting and reputation mechanisms as centerpieces of their design to help users identify the trustworthiness and accuracy of the content.
 To better understand this shift in focus from one-off answers to a group knowledge-creation process, we consider a question together with its entire set of corresponding answers as our fundamental unit of analysis, in contrast with the focus on individual question-answer pairs that characterized previous work. Our investigation considers the dynamics of the community activity that shapes the set of answers, both how answers and voters arrive over time and how this influences the eventual outcome. For example, we observe significant assortativity in the reputations of co-answerers, relationships between reputation and answer speed, and that the probability of an answer being chosen as the best one strongly depends on temporal characteristics of answer arrivals. We then show that our understanding of such properties is naturally applicable to predicting several important quantities, including the long-term value of the question and its answers, as well as whether a question requires a better answer. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results for the design of Q&A sites.",KDD
Debiasing Crowdsourced Batches,2015,"Crowdsourcing is the de-facto standard for gathering annotated data. While, in theory, data annotation tasks are assumed to be attempted by workers independently, in practice, data annotation tasks are often grouped into batches to be presented and annotated by workers together, in order to save on the time or cost overhead of providing instructions or necessary background. Thus, even though independence is usually assumed between annotations on data items within the same batch, in most cases, a worker's judgment on a data item can still be affected by other data items within the batch, leading to additional errors in collected labels. In this paper, we study the data annotation bias when data items are presented as batches to be judged by workers simultaneously. We propose a novel worker model to characterize the annotating behavior on data batches, and present how to train the worker model on annotation data sets. We also present a debiasing technique to remove the effect of such annotation bias from adversely affecting the accuracy of labels obtained. Our experimental results on synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve up to +57% improvement in F1-score compared to the standard majority voting baseline.",KDD
Who Supported Obama in 2012?: Ecological Inference through Distribution Regression,2015,"We present a new solution to the ``ecological inference'' problem, of learning individual-level associations from aggregate data. This problem has a long history and has attracted much attention, debate, claims that it is unsolvable, and purported solutions. Unlike other ecological inference techniques, our method makes use of unlabeled individual-level data by embedding the distribution over these predictors into a vector in Hilbert space. Our approach relies on recent learning theory results for distribution regression, using kernel embeddings of distributions. Our novel approach to distribution regression exploits the connection between Gaussian process regression and kernel ridge regression, giving us a coherent, Bayesian approach to learning and inference and a convenient way to include prior information in the form of a spatial covariance function. Our approach is highly scalable as it relies on FastFood, a randomized explicit feature representation for kernel embeddings. We apply our approach to the challenging political science problem of modeling the voting behavior of demographic groups based on aggregate voting data. We consider the 2012 US Presidential election, and ask: what was the probability that members of various demographic groups supported Barack Obama, and how did this vary spatially across the country? Our results match standard survey-based exit polling data for the small number of states for which it is available, and serve to fill in the large gaps in this data, at a much higher degree of granularity.",KDD

The analysis is based on a Bayesian formalism, with fast inference via a stochastic variational Bayesian analysis.",KDD
Topic-factorized ideal point estimation model for legislative voting network,2014,"Ideal point estimation that estimates legislators' ideological positions and understands their voting behavior has attracted studies from political science and computer science. Typically, a legislator is assigned a global ideal point based on her voting or other social behavior. However, it is quite normal that people may have different positions on different policy dimensions. For example, some people may be more liberal on economic issues while more conservative on cultural issues. In this paper, we propose a novel topic-factorized ideal point estimation model for a legislative voting network in a unified framework. First, we model the ideal points of legislators and bills for each topic instead of assigning them to a global one. Second, the generation of topics are guided by the voting matrix in addition to the text information contained in bills. A unified model that combines voting behavior modeling and topic modeling is presented, and an iterative learning algorithm is proposed to learn the topics of bills as well as the topic-factorized ideal points of legislators and bills. By comparing with the state-of-the-art ideal point estimation models, our method has a much better explanation power in terms of held-out log-likelihood and other measures. Besides, case studies show that the topic-factorized ideal points coincide with human intuition. Finally, we illustrate how to use these topic-factorized ideal points to predict voting results for unseen bills.",KDD
Neural Ideal Point Estimation Network,2018,"Understanding politics is challenging because the politics take the influence from everything. Even we limit ourselves to the political context in the legislative processes; we need a better understanding of latent factors, such as legislators, bills, their ideal points, and their relations. From the modeling perspective, this is difficult 1) because these observations lie in a high dimension that requires learning on low dimensional representations, and 2) because these observations require complex probabilistic modeling with latent variables to reflect the causalities. This paper presents a new model to reflect and understand this political setting, NIPEN, including factors mentioned above in the legislation. We propose two versions of NIPEN: one is a hybrid model of deep learning and probabilistic graphical model, and the other model is a neural tensor model. Our result indicates that NIPEN successfully learns the manifold of the legislative bill's text, and NIPEN utilizes the learned low-dimensional latent variables to increase the prediction performance of legislators' votings. Additionally, by virtue of being a domain-rich probabilistic model, NIPEN shows the hidden strength of the legislators' trust network and their various characteristics on casting votes.",AAAI
TrioVecEvent: Embedding-Based Online Local Event Detection in Geo-Tagged Tweet Streams,2017,"Detecting local events (e.g., protest, disaster) at their onsets is an important task for a wide spectrum of applications, ranging from disaster control to crime monitoring and place recommendation. Recent years have witnessed growing interest in leveraging geo-tagged tweet streams for online local event detection. Nevertheless, the accuracies of existing methods still remain unsatisfactory for building reliable local event detection systems. We propose TrioVecEvent, a method that leverages multimodal embeddings to achieve accurate online local event detection. The effectiveness of TrioVecEvent is underpinned by its two-step detection scheme. First, it ensures a high coverage of the underlying local events by dividing the tweets in the query window into coherent geo-topic clusters. To generate quality geo-topic clusters, we capture short-text semantics by learning multimodal embeddings of the location, time, and text, and then perform online clustering with a novel Bayesian mixture model. Second, TrioVecEvent considers the geo-topic clusters as candidate events and extracts a set of features for classifying the candidates. Leveraging the multimodal embeddings as background knowledge, we introduce discriminative features that can well characterize local events, which enables pinpointing true local events from the candidate pool with a small amount of training data. We have used crowdsourcing to evaluate TrioVecEvent, and found that it improves the performance of the state-of-the-art method by a large margin.",KDD
Understanding City Traffic Dynamics Utilizing Sensor and Textual Observations,2016,"Understanding speed and travel-time dynamics in response to various city related events is an important and challenging problem. Sensor data (numerical) containing average speed of vehicles passing through a road link can be interpreted in terms of traffic related incident reports from city authorities and social media data (textual), providing a complementary understanding of traffic dynamics. State-of-the-art research is focused on either analyzing sensor observations or citizen observations; we seek to exploit both in a synergistic manner. We demonstrate the role of domain knowledge in capturing the non-linearity of speed and travel-time dynamics by segmenting speed and travel-time observations into simpler components amenable to description using linear models such as Linear Dynamical System (LDS). Specifically, we propose Restricted Switching Linear Dynamical System (RSLDS) to model normal speed and travel time dynamics and thereby characterize anomalous dynamics. We utilize the city traffic events extracted from text to explain anomalous dynamics. We present a large scale evaluation of the proposed approach on a real-world traffic and twitter dataset collected over a year with promising results.",AAAI
SnapNETS: Automatic Segmentation of Network Sequences with Node Labels,2017,"Given a sequence of snapshots of flu propagating over a population network, can we find a segmentation when the patterns of the disease spread change, possibly due to interventions? In this paper, we study the problem of segmenting graph sequences with labeled nodes. Memes on the Twitter network, diseases over a contact network, movie-cascades over a social network, etc. are all graph sequences with labeled nodes. Most related work is on plain graphs (and hence ignore the label dynamics) or fix parameters or require much feature engineering. Instead, we propose SnapNETS, to automatically find segmentations of such graph sequences, with different characteristics of nodes of each label in adjacent segments. It satisfies all the desired properties (being parameter-free, comprehensive and scalable) by leveraging a principled, multi-level, flexible framework which maps the problem to a path optimization problem over a weighted DAG. Extensive experiments on several diverse real datasets show that it finds cut points matching ground-truth or meaningful external signals outperforming non-trivial baselines. We also show that SnapNETS scales near-linearly with the size of the input.",AAAI
Sharing Rides with Friends: A Coalition Formation Algorithm for Ridesharing,2015,"We consider the Social Ridesharing (SR) problem, where a set of commuters, connected through a social network, arrange one-time rides at short notice. In particular, we focus on the associated optimisation problem of forming cars to minimise the travel cost of the overall system modelling such problem as a graph constrained coalition formation (GCCF) problem, where the set of feasible coalitions is restricted by a graph (i.e., the social network). Moreover, we significantly extend the state of the art algorithm for GCCF, i.e., the CFSS algorithm, to solve our GCCF model of the SR problem. Our empirical evaluation uses a real dataset for both spatial (GeoLife) and social data (Twitter), to validate the applicability of our approach in a realistic application scenario. Empirical results show that our approach computes optimal solutions for systems of medium scale (up to 100 agents) providing significant cost reductions (up to -36.22%). Moreover, we can provide approximate solutions for very large systems (i.e., up to 2000 agents) and good quality guarantees (i.e., with an approximation ratio of 1.41 in the worst case) within minutes (i.e., 100 seconds).",AAAI
"Who, where, when and what: discover spatio-temporal topics for twitter users",2013,"Micro-blogging services, such as Twitter, and location-based social network applications have generated short text messages associated with geographic information, posting time, and user ids. The availability of such data received from users offers a good opportunity to study the user's spatial-temporal behavior and preference. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model W4 (short for Who+Where+When+What) to exploit such data to discover individual users' mobility behaviors from spatial, temporal and activity aspects. To the best of our knowledge, our work offers the first solution to jointly model individual user's mobility behavior from the three aspects. Our model has a variety of applications, such as user profiling and location prediction; it can be employed to answer questions such as ``Can we infer the location of a user given a tweet posted by the user and the posting time?"" Experimental results on two real-world datasets show that the proposed model is effective in discovering users' spatial-temporal topics, and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines significantly for the task of location prediction for tweets.",KDD
Assessing the resilience of bilingual societies: coupling viability and active learning with kd-tree,2013,"Monitoring and forecast of global spread of infectious diseases is difficult, mainly due to lack of fine-grained and timely data. Previous work in computational epidemiology has shown that mining data from the web can improve the predictability of high-level aggregate patterns of epidemics. By contrast, this paper explores how individuals contribute to the global spread of disease. We consider the important task of predicting the prevalence of flu-like illness in a given city based on interpersonal interactions of the city's residents with the outside world. We use the geo-tagged status updates of traveling Twitter users to infer properties of the flow of individuals between cities. While previous research considered only the raw volume of passengers, we estimate a number of latent variables, including the number of sick (symptomatic) travelers and the number of sick individuals to whom each traveler was exposed. We show that AI techniques provide insights into the mechanisms of disease spread and significantly improve predictability of future flu outbreaks. Our experiments involve over 51,000 individuals traveling between 75 cities prior and during a severe ongoing flu epidemic (October 2012 - January 2013). Our model leverages the text and interpersonal interactions recorded in over 6.5 million online status updates without any active user participation, enabling scalable public health applications.",IJCAI
Modeling human location data with mixtures of kernel densities,2014,"Location-based data is increasingly prevalent with the rapid increase and adoption of mobile devices. In this paper we address the problem of learning spatial density models, focusing specifically on individual-level data. Modeling and predicting a spatial distribution for an individual is a challenging problem given both (a) the typical sparsity of data at the individual level and (b) the heterogeneity of spatial mobility patterns across individuals. We investigate the application of kernel density estimation (KDE) to this problem using a mixture model approach that can interpolate between an individual's data and broader patterns in the population as a whole. The mixture-KDE approach is evaluated on two large geolocation/check-in data sets, from Twitter and Gowalla, with comparisons to non-KDE baselines, using both log-likelihood and detection of simulated identity theft as evaluation metrics. Our experimental results indicate that the mixture-KDE method provides a useful and accurate methodology for capturing and predicting individual-level spatial patterns in the presence of noisy and sparse data.",KDD
Deploying nEmesis: Preventing Foodborne Illness by Data Mining Social Media,2016,"Foodborne illness afflicts 48 million people annually in the U.S.alone. Over 128,000 are hospitalized and 3,000 die from the infection.While preventable with proper food safety practices, the traditional restaurant inspection process has limited impact given the predictability and low frequency of inspections, and the dynamic nature of the kitchen environment. Despite this reality, the inspection process has remained largely unchanged for decades. We apply machine learning to Twitter data and develop a system that automatically detects venues likely to pose a public health hazard.Health professionals subsequently inspect individual flagged venues in a double blind experiment spanning the entire Las Vegas metropolitan area over three months. By contrast, previous research in this domain has been limited to indirect correlative validation using only aggregate statistics. We show that adaptive inspection process is 63% more effective at identifying problematic venues than the current state of the art. The live deployment shows that if every inspection in Las Vegas became adaptive, we can prevent over 9,000 cases of foodborne illness and 557 hospitalizations annually. Additionally,adaptive inspections result in unexpected benefits, including the identification of venues lacking permits, contagious kitchen staff,and fewer customer complaints filed with the Las Vegas health department.",AAAI
Cross-Domain Depression Detection via Harvesting Social Media,2018,"Depression detection is a significant issue for human well-being. In previous studies, online detection has proven effective in Twitter, enabling proactive care for depressed users. Owing to cultural differences, replicating the method to other social media platforms, such as Chinese Weibo, however, might lead to poor performance because of insufficient available labeled (self-reported depression) data for model training. In this paper, we study an interesting but challenging problem of enhancing detection in a certain target domain (e.g. Weibo) with ample Twitter data as the source domain. We first systematically analyze the depression-related feature patterns across domains and summarize two major detection challenges, namely isomerism and divergency. We further propose a cross-domain Deep Neural Network model with Feature Adaptive Transformation & Combination strategy (DNN-FATC) that transfers the relevant information across heterogeneous domains. Experiments demonstrate improved performance compared to existing heterogeneous transfer methods or training directly in the target domain (over 3.4% improvement in F1), indicating the potential of our model to enable depression detection via social media for more countries with different cultural settings.",IJCAI
Let's See Your Digits: Anomalous-State Detection using Benford's Law,2017,"Benford's Law explains a curious phenomenon in which the leading digits of ""naturally-occurring"" numerical data are distributed in a precise fashion. In this paper we begin by showing that system metrics generated by many modern information systems like Twitter, Wikipedia, YouTube and GitHub obey this law. We then propose a novel unsupervised approach called BenFound that exploits this property to detect anomalous system events. BenFound tracks the ""Benfordness"" of key system metrics, like the follower counts of tweeting Twitter users or the change deltas in Wikipedia page edits. It then applies a novel Benford-conformity test in real-time to identify ""non-Benford events"". We investigate a variety of such events, showing that they correspond to unnatural and often undesirable system interactions like spamming, hashtag-hijacking and denial-of-service attacks. The result is a technically-uncomplicated and effective ""red flagging"" technique that can be used to complement existing anomaly-detection approaches. Although not without its limitations, it is highly efficient and requires neither obscure parameters, nor text streams, nor natural-language processing.",KDD
EARS (earthquake alert and report system): a real time decision support system for earthquake crisis management,2014,"Social sensing is based on the idea that communities or groups of people can provide a set of information similar to those obtainable from a sensor network. Emergency management is a candidate field of application for social sensing. In this work we describe the design, implementation and deployment of a decision support system for the detection and the damage assessment of earthquakes in Italy. Our system exploits the messages shared in real-time on Twitter, one of the most popular social networks in the world. Data mining and natural language processing techniques are employed to select meaningful and comprehensive sets of tweets. We then apply a burst detection algorithm in order to promptly identify outbreaking seismic events. Detected events are automatically broadcasted by our system via a dedicated Twitter account and by email notifications. In addition, we mine the content of the messages associated to an event to discover knowledge on its consequences. Finally we compare our results with official data provided by the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV), the authority responsible for monitoring seismic events in Italy. The INGV network detects shaking levels produced by the earthquake, but can only model the damage scenario by using empirical relationships. This scenario can be greatly improved with direct information site by site. Results show that the system has a great ability to detect events of a magnitude in the region of 3.5, with relatively low occurrences of false positives. Earthquake detection mostly occurs within seconds of the event and far earlier than the notifications shared by INGV or by other official channels. Thus, we are able to alert interested parties promptly. Information discovered by our system can be extremely useful to all the government agencies interested in mitigating the impact of earthquakes, as well as the news agencies looking for fresh information to publish.",KDD
Depression Detection via Harvesting Social Media: A Multimodal Dictionary Learning Solution,2017,"Depression is a major contributor to the overall global burden of diseases. Traditionally, doctors diagnose depressed people face to face via referring to clinical depression criteria. However, more than 70% of the patients would not consult doctors at early stages of depression, which leads to further deterioration of their conditions. Meanwhile, people are increasingly relying on social media to disclose emotions and sharing their daily lives, thus social media have successfully been leveraged for helping detect physical and mental diseases. Inspired by these, our work aims to make timely depression detection via harvesting social media data. We construct well-labeled depression and non-depression dataset on Twitter, and extract six depression-related feature groups covering not only the clinical depression criteria, but also online behaviors on social media. With these feature groups, we propose a multimodal depressive dictionary learning model to detect the depressed users on Twitter. A series of experiments are conducted to validate this model, which outperforms (+3% to +10%) several baselines. Finally, we analyze a large-scale dataset on Twitter to reveal the underlying online behaviors between depressed and non-depressed users.",IJCAI
Using Twitter to Predict When Vulnerabilities will be Exploited,2019,"When a new cyber-vulnerability is detected, a Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) number is attached to it. Malicious ""exploits'' may use these vulnerabilities to carry out attacks. Unlike works which study if a CVE will be used in an exploit, we study the problem of predicting when an exploit is first seen. This is an important question for system administrators as they need to devote scarce resources to take corrective action when a new vulnerability emerges. Moreover, past works assume that CVSS scores (released by NIST) are available for predictions, but we show on average that 49% of real world exploits occur before CVSS scores are published. This means that past works, which use CVSS scores, miss almost half of the exploits. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to predict when a vulnerability will be exploited via Twitter discussion, without using CVSS score information. We introduce the unique concept of a family of CVE-Author-Tweet (CAT) graphs and build a novel set of features based on such graphs. We define recurrence relations capturing ""hotness"" of tweets, ""expertise"" of Twitter users on CVEs, and ""availability"" of information about CVEs, and prove that we can solve these recurrences via a fix point algorithm. Our second innovation adopts Hawkes processes to estimate the number of tweets/retweets related to the CVEs. Using the above two sets of novel features, we propose two ensemble forecast models FEEU (for classification) and FRET (for regression) to predict when a CVE will be exploited. Compared with natural adaptations of past works (which predict if an exploit will be used), FEEU increases F1 score by 25.1%, while FRET decreases MAE by 37.2%.",KDD
Automatic Opioid User Detection from Twitter: Transductive Ensemble Built on Different Meta-graph Based Similarities over Heterogeneous Information Network,2018,"""Opioid (e.g., heroin and morphine) addiction has become one of the largest and deadliest epidemics in the United States. To combat such deadly epidemic, in this paper, we propose a novel framework named HinOPU to automatically detect opioid users from Twitter, which will assist in sharpening our understanding toward the behavioral process of opioid addiction and treatment. In HinOPU, to model the users and the posted tweets as well as their rich relationships, we introduce structured heterogeneous information network (HIN) for representation. Afterwards, we use meta-graph based approach to characterize the semantic relatedness over users; we then formulate different similarities over users based on different meta-graphs on HIN. To reduce the cost of acquiring labeled samples for supervised learning, we propose a transductive classification method to build the base classifiers based on different similarities formulated by different meta-graphs. Then, to further improve the detection accuracy, we construct an ensemble to combine different predictions from different base classifiers for opioid user detection. Comprehensive experiments on real sample collections from Twitter are conducted to validate the effectiveness of HinOPU in opioid user detection by comparisons with other alternate methods.""",IJCAI
Face Behind Makeup,2016,"In this work, we propose a novel automatic makeup detector and remover framework. For makeup detector, a locality-constrained low-rank dictionary learning algorithm is used to determine and locate the usage of cosmetics. For the challenging task of makeup removal, a locality-constrained coupled dictionary learning (LC-CDL) framework is proposed to synthesize non-makeup face, so that the makeup could be erased according to the style. Moreover, we build a stepwise makeup dataset (SMU) which to the best of our knowledge is the first dataset with procedures of makeup. This novel technology itself carries many practical applications, e.g. products recommendation for consumers; user-specified makeup tutorial; security applications on makeup face verification. Finally, our system is evaluated on three existing (VMU, MIW, YMU) and one own-collected makeup datasets. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of DL-based method on makeup detection. The proposed LC-CDL shows very promising performance on makeup removal regarding on the structure similarity. In addition, the comparison of face verification accuracy with presence or absence of makeup is presented, which illustrates an application of our automatic makeup remover system in the context of face verification with facial makeup.",AAAI
A Machine Learning Approach to the Detection of Fetal Hypoxia during Labor and Delivery,2010,"Labor monitoring is crucial in modern health care, as it can be used to detect (and help avoid) significant problems with the fetus. In this paper we focus on hypoxia (or oxygen deprivation), a very serious condition that can arise from different pathologies and can lead to life-long disability and death. We present a novel approach to hypoxia detection based on recordings of the uterine pressure and fetal heart rate, which are routinely monitored during labor. The key idea is to learn models of the fetal response to signals from its environment, using time series data recorded during labor. Then, we use the parameters of these models as attributes in a binary classification problem. A majority vote over several periods is taken to provide the current label for the fetus. We use a unique database of real clinical recordings, both from normal and pathological cases. Our approach classifies correctly more than half the pathological cases, 1.5 hours before delivery. These are cases that were missed by clinicians; early detection of this type would have allowed the physician to perform a Caesarean section, possibly avoiding the negative outcome",AAAI
Knowledge discovery from massive healthcare claims data,2013,"he role of big data in addressing the needs of the present healthcare system in US and rest of the world has been echoed by government, private, and academic sectors. There has been a growing emphasis to explore the promise of big data analytics in tapping the potential of the massive healthcare data emanating from private and government health insurance providers. While the domain implications of such collaboration are well known, this type of data has been explored to a limited extent in the data mining community. The objective of this paper is two fold: first, we introduce the emerging domain of ""big"" healthcare claims data to the KDD community, and second, we describe the success and challenges that we encountered in analyzing this data using state of art analytics for massive data. Specifically, we translate the problem of analyzing healthcare data into some of the most well-known analysis problems in the data mining community, social network analysis, text mining, and temporal analysis and higher order feature construction, and describe how advances within each of these areas can be leveraged to understand the domain of healthcare. Each case study illustrates a unique intersection of data mining and healthcare with a common objective of improving the cost-care ratio by mining for opportunities to improve healthcare operations and reducing what seems to fall under fraud, waste, and abuse.",KDD
Early Identification of Violent Criminal Gang Members,2015,"Gang violence is a major problem in the United States accounting for a large fraction of homicides and other violent crime. In this paper, we study the problem of early identification of violent gang members. Our approach relies on modified centrality measures that take into account additional data of the individuals in the social network of co-arrestees which together with other arrest metadata provide a rich set of features for a classification algorithm. We show our approach obtains high precision and recall (0.89 and 0.78 respectively) in the case where the entire network is known and out-performs current approaches used by law-enforcement to the problem in the case where the network is discovered overtime by virtue of new arrests - mimicking real-world law-enforcement operations.

On the privacy of anonymized networks,2011,"The proliferation of online social networks, and the concomitant accumulation of user data, give rise to hotly debated issues of privacy, security, and control. One specific challenge is the sharing or public release of anonymized data without accidentally leaking personally identifiable information (PII). Unfortunately, it is often difficult to ascertain that sophisticated statistical techniques, potentially employing additional external data sources, are unable to break anonymity. In this paper, we consider an instance of this problem, where the object of interest is the structure of a social network, i.e., a graph describing users and their links. Recent work demonstrates that anonymizing node identities may not be sufficient to keep the network private: the availability of node and link data from another domain, which is correlated with the anonymized network, has been used to re-identify the anonymized nodes. This paper is about conditions under which such a de-anonymization process is possible.
 We attempt to shed light on the following question: can we assume that a sufficiently sparse network is inherently anonymous, in the sense that even with unlimited computational power, de-anonymization is impossible? Our approach is to introduce a random graph model for a version of the de-anonymization problem, which is parameterized by the expected node degree and a similarity parameter that controls the correlation between two graphs over the same vertex set. We find simple conditions on these parameters delineating the boundary of privacy, and show that the mean node degree need only grow slightly faster than log n with network size n for nodes to be identifiable. Our results have policy implications for sharing of anonymized network information.",KDD
Characterizing and Detecting Malicious Accounts in Privacy-Centric Mobile Social Networks: A Case Study,2019,"Malicious accounts are one of the biggest threats to the security and privacy of online social networks (OSNs). In this work, we study a new type of OSN, called privacy-centric mobile social network (PC-MSN), such as KakaoTalk and LINE, which has attracted billions of users recently. The design of PC-MSN is inspired to protect their users' privacy from strangers: (1) a stranger is not easy to send a friend request to a user who does not want to make friends with strangers; and (2) strangers cannot view a user's post. Such a design mitigates the security issue of malicious accounts. At the same time, it also brings the battleground between attackers and defenders to an earlier stage, i.e., making friendship, than the one studied in previous works. Also, previous defense proposals mostly rely on certain assumptions on the attacker, which may not be robust in the new PC-MSNs. As a result, previous malicious accounts detection approaches are less effective on a PC-MSN.
 To mitigate this issue, we study the patterns in friend requests to distinguish malicious accounts, and perform a systematic study over 1 million labeled data from WLink, a real PC-MSN with billions of users, to confirm our hypothesis. Based on the results, we propose dozens of new features and leverage machine learning to detect malicious accounts. We evaluate our method and compare it with existing methods, and the results show that our method achieves a precision of 99.5% and a recall of 98.4%, which significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art methods. Importantly, we qualitatively analyze the robustness of the designed features, and our evaluation shows that using only robust features can achieve the same level of performance as using all features. WLink has deployed our detection method. Our method can detect 0.59 million malicious accounts daily, which is 6 times higher than the previous deployment on WLink, with a precision of over 90%.",KDD
Cascading outbreak prediction in networks: a data-driven approach,2013,"Cascades are ubiquitous in various network environments such as epidemic networks, traffic networks, water distribution networks and social networks. The outbreaks of cascades will often bring bad or even devastating effects. How to accurately predict the cascading outbreaks in early stage is of paramount importance for people to avoid these bad effects. Although there have been some pioneering works on cascading outbreaks detection, how to predict, rather than detect, the cascading outbreaks is still an open problem. In this paper, we attempt harnessing historical cascade data, propose a novel data driven approach to select important nodes as sensors, and predict the outbreaks based on the cascading behaviors of these sensors. In particular, we propose Orthogonal Sparse LOgistic Regression (OSLOR) method to jointly optimize node selection and outbreak prediction, where the prediction loss are combined with an orthogonal regularizer and L1 regularizer to guarantee good prediction accuracy, as well as the sparsity and low-redundancy of selected sensors. We evaluate the proposed method on a real online social network dataset including 182.7 million information cascades. The experimental results show that the proposed OSLOR significantly and consistently outperform topological measure based method and other data driven methods in prediction performances.",KDD
Recurrent Marked Temporal Point Processes: Embedding Event History to Vector,2016,"Large volumes of event data are becoming increasingly available in a wide variety of applications, such as healthcare analytics, smart cities and social network analysis. The precise time interval or the exact distance between two events carries a great deal of information about the dynamics of the underlying systems. These characteristics make such data fundamentally different from independently and identically distributed data and time-series data where time and space are treated as indexes rather than random variables. Marked temporal point processes are the mathematical framework for modeling event data with covariates. However, typical point process models often make strong assumptions about the generative processes of the event data, which may or may not reflect the reality, and the specifically fixed parametric assumptions also have restricted the expressive power of the respective processes. Can we obtain a more expressive model of marked temporal point processes? How can we learn such a model from massive data?
 In this paper, we propose the Recurrent Marked Temporal Point Process (RMTPP) to simultaneously model the event timings and the markers. The key idea of our approach is to view the intensity function of a temporal point process as a nonlinear function of the history, and use a recurrent neural network to automatically learn a representation of influences from the event history. We develop an efficient stochastic gradient algorithm for learning the model parameters which can readily scale up to millions of events. Using both synthetic and real world datasets, we show that, in the case where the true models have parametric specifications, RMTPP can learn the dynamics of such models without the need to know the actual parametric forms; and in the case where the true models are unknown, RMTPP can also learn the dynamics and achieve better predictive performance than other parametric alternatives based on particular prior assumptions.",KDD
Unified and Contrasting Cuts in Multiple Graphs: Application to Medical Imaging Segmentation,2015,"The analysis of data represented as graphs is common having wide scale applications from social networks to medical imaging. A popular analysis is to cut the graph so that the disjoint subgraphs can represent communities (for social network) or background and foreground cognitive activity (for medical imaging). An emerging setting is when multiple data sets (graphs) exist which opens up the opportunity for many new questions. In this paper we study two such questions: i) For a collection of graphs find a single cut that is good for all the graphs and ii) For two collections of graphs find a single cut that is good for one collection but poor for the other. We show that existing formulations of multiview, consensus and alternative clustering cannot address these questions and instead we provide novel formulations in the spectral clustering framework. We evaluate our approaches on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to address questions such as: ""What common cognitive network does this group of individuals have?"" and ""What are the differences in the cognitive networks for these two groups?"" We obtain useful results without the need for strong domain knowledge.",KDD
Preventing HIV Spread in Homeless Populations Using PSINET,2015,"Homeless youth are prone to HIV due to their engagement in high risk behavior. Many agencies conduct interventions to educate/train a select group of homeless youth about HIV prevention practices and rely on word-of-mouth spread of information through their social network. Previous work in strategic selection of intervention participants does not handle uncertainties in the social network's structure and in the evolving network state, potentially causing significant shortcomings in spread of information. Thus, we developed PSINET, a decision support system to aid the agencies in this task. PSINET includes the following key novelties: (i) it handles uncertainties in network structure and evolving network state; (ii) it addresses these uncertainties by using POMDPs in influence maximization; (iii) it provides algorithmic advances to allow high quality approximate solutions for such POMDPs. Simulations show that PSINET achieves around 60% more information spread over the current state-of-the-art. PSINET was developed in collaboration with My Friend's Place (a drop-in agency serving homeless youth in Los Angeles) and is currently being reviewed by their officials.",AAAI
People on drugs: credibility of user statements in health communities,2014,"Online health communities are a valuable source of information for patients and physicians. However, such user-generated resources are often plagued by inaccuracies and misinformation. In this work we propose a method for automatically establishing the credibility of user-generated medical statements and the trustworthiness of their authors by exploiting linguistic cues and distant supervision from expert sources. To this end we introduce a probabilistic graphical model that jointly learns user trustworthiness, statement credibility, and language objectivity.
 We apply this methodology to the task of extracting rare or unknown side-effects of medical drugs --- this being one of the problems where large scale non-expert data has the potential to complement expert medical knowledge. We show that our method can reliably extract side-effects and filter out false statements, while identifying trustworthy users that are likely to contribute valuable medical information.",KDD
Mining lines in the sand: on trajectory discovery from untrustworthy data in cyber-physical system,2013,"A Cyber-Physical System (CPS) integrates physical (i.e., sensor) devices with cyber (i.e., informational) components to form a context sensitive system that responds intelligently to dynamic changes in real-world situations. The CPS has wide applications in scenarios such as environment monitoring, battlefield surveillance and traffic control. One key research problem of CPS is called ""mining lines in the sand"". With a large number of sensors (sand) deployed in a designated area, the CPS is required to discover all the trajectories (lines) of passing intruders in real time. There are two crucial challenges that need to be addressed: (1) the collected sensor data are not trustworthy; (2) the intruders do not send out any identification information. The system needs to distinguish multiple intruders and track their movements. In this study, we propose a method called LiSM (Line-in-the-Sand Miner) to discover trajectories from untrustworthy sensor data. LiSM constructs a watching network from sensor data and computes the locations of intruder appearances based on the link information of the network. The system retrieves a cone-model from the historical trajectories and tracks multiple intruders based on this model. Finally the system validates the mining results and updates the sensor's reliability in a feedback process. Extensive experiments on big datasets demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed methods.",KDD
Diagnosing Sample Ratio Mismatch in Online Controlled Experiments: A Taxonomy and Rules of Thumb for Practitioners,2019,"Accurately learning what delivers value to customers is difficult. Online Controlled Experiments (OCEs), aka A/B tests, are becoming a standard operating procedure in software companies to address this challenge as they can detect small causal changes in user behavior due to product modifications (e.g. new features). However, like any data analysis method, OCEs are sensitive to trustworthiness and data quality issues which, if go unaddressed or unnoticed, may result in making wrong decisions. One of the most useful indicators of a variety of data quality issues is a Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM) ? the situation when the observed sample ratio in the experiment is different from the expected. Just like fever is a symptom for multiple types of illness, an SRM is a symptom for a variety of data quality issues. While a simple statistical check is used to detect an SRM, correctly identifying the root cause and preventing it from happening in the future is often extremely challenging and time consuming. Ignoring the SRM without knowing the root cause may result in a bad product modification appearing to be good and getting shipped to users, or vice versa. The goal of this paper is to make diagnosing, fixing, and preventing SRMs easier. Based on our experience of running OCEs in four different software companies in over 25 different products used by hundreds of millions of users worldwide, we have derived a taxonomy for different types of SRMs. We share examples, detection guidelines, and best practices for preventing SRMs of each type. We hope that the lessons and practical tips we describe in this paper will speed up SRM investigations and prevent some of them. Ultimately, this should lead to improved decision making based on trustworthy experiment analysis.",KDD
Exploiting user clicks for automatic seed set generation for entity matching,2013,"Matching entities from different information sources is a very important problem in data analysis and data integration. It is, however, challenging due to the number and diversity of information sources involved, and the significant editorial efforts required to collect sufficient training data. In this paper, we present an approach that leverages user clicks during Web search to automatically generate training data for entity matching. The key insight of our approach is that Web pages clicked for a given query are likely to be about the same entity. We use random walk with restart to reduce data sparseness, rely on co-clustering to group queries and Web pages, and exploit page similarity to improve matching precision. Experimental results show that: (i) With 360K pages from 6 major travel websites, we obtain 84K matchings (of 179K pages) that refer to the same entities, with an average precision of 0.826; (ii) The quality of matching obtained from a classifier trained on the resulted seed data is promising: the performance matches that of editorial data at small size and improves with size.",KDD
Using Social Networks to Aid Homeless Shelters: Dynamic Influence Maximization under Uncertainty (Page 740),2016,"This paper presents HEALER, a software agent that recommends sequential intervention plans for use by homeless shelters, who organize these interventions to raise awareness about HIV among homeless youth. HEALER's sequential plans (built using knowledge of social networks of homeless youth) choose intervention participants strategically to maximize influence spread, while reasoning about uncertainties in the network. While previous work presents influence maximizing techniques to choose intervention participants, they do not address three real-world issues: (i) they completely fail to scale up to real-world sizes; (ii) they do not handle deviations in execution of intervention plans; (iii) constructing real-world social networks is an expensive process. HEALER handles these issues via four major contributions: (i) HEALER casts this influence maximization problem as a POMDP and solves it using a novel planner which scales up to previously unsolvable real-world sizes; (ii) HEALER allows shelter officials to modify its recommendations, and updates its future plans in a deviation-tolerant manner; (iii) HEALER constructs social networks of homeless youth at low cost, using a Facebook application. Finally, (iv) we show hardness results for the problem that HEALER solves. HEALER will be deployed in the real world in early Spring 2016 and is currently undergoing testing at a homeless shelter.",AAMAS
Responses to Riverbank Erosion in Bangladesh,2018,"In this paper, we examine riverbank erosion in Bangladesh, a crisis that affects millions of people, but has largely been overlooked in the ICT4D and crisis informatics literature. Through a two-month field study in four districts of Bangladesh, we explored how people managed the impacts of erosion. Our study reveals that riverbank erosion resulted in material loss, forced migration, and social displacement. Victims faced many challenges but received little institutional support. We combined the ethnographic field study with an online social media study to present a holistic picture of the activities of crisis response. In the field sites, we observed that ICT use was limited to phone calls because the internet was inaccessible. However, our analysis of online social media activity in two nearby regions revealed strong Facebook activism. Activists used Facebook to raise public awareness about riverbank erosion and push for political change.",COMPASS
Separating Wheat from Chaff: Joining Biomedical Knowledge and Patient Data for Repurposing Medications,2019,"We present a system that jointly harnesses large-scale electronic health records data and a concept graph mined from the medical literature to guide drug repurposingÃ¢â¬âthe process of applying known drugs in new ways to treat diseases. Our study is unique in methods and scope, per the scale of the concept graph and the quantity of data. We harness 10 years of nation-wide medical records of more than 1.5 million people and extract medical knowledge from all of PubMed, the worldÃ¢â¬â¢s largest corpus of online biomedical literature. We employ links on the concept graph to provide causal signals to prioritize candidate influences between medications and target diseases. We show results of the system on studies of drug repurposing for hypertension and diabetes. In both cases, we present drug families identified by the algorithm which were previously unknown. We verify the results via clinical expert opinion and by prospective clinical trials on hypertension.",AAAI
Unsupervised Clinical Language Translation,2019,"As patients' access to their doctors' clinical notes becomes common, translating professional, clinical jargon to layperson-understandable language is essential to improve patient-clinician communication. Such translation yields better clinical outcomes by enhancing patients' understanding of their own health conditions, and thus improving patients' involvement in their own care. Existing research has used dictionary-based word replacement or definition insertion to approach the need. However, these methods are limited by expert curation, which is hard to scale and has trouble generalizing to unseen datasets that do not share an overlapping vocabulary. In contrast, we approach the clinical word and sentence translation problem in a completely unsupervised manner. We show that a framework using representation learning, bilingual dictionary induction and statistical machine translation yields the best precision at 10 of 0.827 on professional-to-consumer word translation, and mean opinion scores of 4.10 and 4.28 out of 5 for clinical correctness and layperson readability, respectively, on sentence translation. Our fully-unsupervised strategy overcomes the curation problem, and the clinically meaningful evaluation reduces biases from inappropriate evaluators, which are critical in clinical machine learning.",KDD
Understanding the Needs of Prospective Tenants,2018,"Housing quality can impact quality of life factors such as physical health and finances. However, prospective tenants lack critical information about things like utility costs and landlord quality. Our contribution is a series of three studies exploring the complexities of the information economy around rental housing, including information available to landlords but not tenants, as well as information tenants may not prioritize until after lease signing about their own desires. Our first mixed methods study demonstrates that tenants cannot easily predict factors impacting the quality of life when selecting a rental and need better information about rental housing and the overall rental system. Using speed dating, we explore scenarios premised on information sharing and quality of life to analyze risks and rewards of crowdsourced information collection and sharing within a multi-stakeholder peer-to-peer rental search system. Finally, we present eDigs, a rental search system we have deployed to enhance the information economy for prospective tenants using a combination of opinion, implicit observation, and communal information. We also explore user responses to the system.",COMPASS
Bringing data science to the speakers of every language,2014,"Speakers of more than 5,000 languages have access to internet and communication technologies. The majority of phones, tablets and computers now ship with language-enabled capabilities like speech-recognition and intelligent auto-correction, and people increasingly interact with data-intensive cloud-based language technologies like search-engines and spam-filters. For both personal and large-scale technologies, the service quality drops or disappears entirely outside of a handful of languages. Speakers of low-resource languages correlate with lower access to healthcare, education and higher vulnerability to disasters. Serving the broadest possible range of languages is crucial to ensuring equitable participation in the global information economy.
 I will present examples of how natural language processing and distributed human computing are improving the lives of speakers of all the world's languages, in areas including education, disaster-response, health and access to employment. When applying natural language processing to the full diversity of the world's communications, we need to go beyond simple keyword analysis and implement complex technologies that require human-in-the-loop processing to ensure usable accuracy. In recent work where more than a million human judgments were collected on unstructured text and imagery data around natural disasters, I will present observations that debunk recent over-optimistic claims about the utility of social media following disasters. On the positive side, I will share results that show how for-profit technologies are improving people's lives by providing sustainable economic growth opportunities when they support more languages, aligning business objectives with global diversity.",KDD
End-to-end Learning for Short Text Expansion,2017,"Effectively making sense of short texts is a critical task for many real world applications such as search engines, social media services, and recommender systems. The task is particularly challenging as a short text contains very sparse information, often too sparse for a machine learning algorithm to pick up useful signals. A common practice for analyzing short text is to first expand it with external information, which is usually harvested from a large collection of longer texts. In literature, short text expansion has been done with all kinds of heuristics. We propose an end-to-end solution that automatically learns how to expand short text to optimize a given learning task. A novel deep memory network is proposed to automatically find relevant information from a collection of longer documents and reformulate the short text through a gating mechanism. Using short text classification as a demonstrating task, we show that the deep memory network significantly outperforms classical text expansion methods with comprehensive experiments on real world data sets.",KDD
Learnings From Deploying A Voice-Based Social Platform For People With Disability,2019,"For people with disability living in low-income neighborhoods, access to technology is compounded by inaccessible designs and relative isolation in poverty. To bring together this segment of population, an NGO in India built Enable Vaani, a voice-based social media platform designed for persons with disability living in rural areas without internet connectivity. This system has been in deployment since 2016 and has reached over 25,000 users. We present a mixed-methods analysis utilizing system logs and qualitative interviews, with the goal of understanding Enable Vaaniâs impact. We find that posts related to employment, education and government programs are the most listened to and shared. Content uploaded by the Enable Vaani team is listened and bookmarked more per post than any user-generated content, indicating the importance of an active role of platform managers. Besides providing useful information, people reported that the platform serves as a medium for social support. Our analysis also finds areas of improvement: people skip a lot of posts, very few people share, and a large fraction of newcomers leave after the first month. In response to these shortcomings, we suggest strategies that can be useful for voice-based systems: active contribution of content, customized content feed, special strategies for encouraging newcomers, and design changes to make sharing easier.",COMPASS
Applying data mining techniques to address disaster information management challenges on mobile devices,2011,"The improvement of Crisis Management and Disaster Recovery techniques are national priorities in the wake of man-made and nature inflicted calamities of the last decade. Our prior work has demonstrated that the efficiency of sharing and managing information plays an important role in business recovery efforts after disaster event. With the proliferation of smart phones and wireless tablets, professionals who have an operational responsibility in disaster situations are relying on such devices to maintain communication. Further, with the rise of social media, technology savvy consumers are also using these devices extensively for situational updates. In this paper, we address several critical tasks which can facilitate information sharing and collaboration between both private and public sector participants for major disaster recovery planning and management. We design and implement an All-Hazard Disaster Situation Browser (ADSB) system that runs on Apple's mobile operating system (iOS) and iPhone and iPad mobile devices. Our proposed techniques create a collaborative solution on a mobile platform using advanced data mining and information retrieval techniques for disaster preparedness and recovery that helps impacted communities better understand the current disaster situation and how the community is recovering. Specifically, hierarchical summarization techniques are used to generate brief reviews from a large collection of reports at different granularities; probabilistic models are proposed to dynamically generate query forms based on user's feedback; and recommendation techniques are adapted to help users identify potential contacts for report sharing and community organization. Furthermore, the developed techniques are designed to be all-hazard capable so that they can be used in earthquake, terrorism, or other unanticipated disaster situations.",KDD
GMove: Group-Level Mobility Modeling Using Geo-Tagged Social Media,2016,"Understanding human mobility is of great importance to various applications, such as urban planning, traffic scheduling, and location prediction. While there has been fruitful research on modeling human mobility using tracking data (e.g., GPS traces), the recent growth of geo-tagged social media (GeoSM) brings new opportunities to this task because of its sheer size and multi-dimensional nature. Nevertheless, how to obtain quality mobility models from the highly sparse and complex GeoSM data remains a challenge that cannot be readily addressed by existing techniques. We propose GMove, a group-level mobility modeling method using GeoSM data. Our insight is that the GeoSM data usually contains multiple user groups, where the users within the same group share significant movement regularity. Meanwhile, user grouping and mobility modeling are two intertwined tasks: (1) better user grouping offers better within-group data consistency and thus leads to more reliable mobility models; and (2) better mobility models serve as useful guidance that helps infer the group a user belongs to. GMove thus alternates between user grouping and mobility modeling, and generates an ensemble of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to characterize group-level movement regularity. Furthermore, to reduce text sparsity of GeoSM data, GMove also features a text augmenter. The augmenter computes keyword correlations by examining their spatiotemporal distributions. With such correlations as auxiliary knowledge, it performs sampling-based augmentation to alleviate text sparsity and produce high-quality HMMs.
 Our extensive experiments on two real-life data sets demonstrate that GMove can effectively generate meaningful group-level mobility models. Moreover, with context-aware location prediction as an example application, we find that GMove significantly outperforms baseline mobility models in terms of prediction accuracy.",KDD
Detecting and Tracking Disease Outbreaks in Real-time through Social Media,2013,"The emergence and ubiquity of online social networks have enriched web data with evolving interactions and communities both at mega-scale and in real-time. This data offers an unprecedented opportunity for studying the interaction between society and disease outbreaks. The challenge we describe in this data paper is how to extract and leverage epidemic outbreak insights from massive amounts of social media data and how this exercise can benefit medical professionals, patients, and policymakers alike. We attempt to prepare the research community for this challenge with four datasets. Publishing the four datasets will commoditize the data infrastructure to allow a higher and more efficient focal point for the research community.",IJCAI
Determining Relative Airport Threats from News and Social Media,2017,"Airports are a prime target for terrorist organizations, drug traffickers, smugglers, and other nefarious groups. Traditional forms of security assessment are not real-time and often do not exist for each airport and port of entry. Thus, homeland security professionals must rely on measures of attractiveness of an airport as a target for attacks. We present an open source indicators approach, using news and social media, to conduct relative threat assessment, i.e., estimating if one airport is under greater threat than another. The three ingredients of our approach are a dynamic query expansion algorithm for tracking emerging threat-related chatter, news-Twitter reciprocity modeling for capturing interactions between social and traditional media, and a ranking scheme to provide an ordered assessment of airport threats. Case studies based on actual aviation incidents are presented.",AAAI
Streaming Analytics,2016,"Recently we have seen emergence and huge adoption of social media, internet of things for home, industrial internet of things, mobile applications and online transactions.

Real-time analysis of streaming data can be used for applications as diverse as fraud detection, in-session targeting and recommendations, control systems for transportation systems and smarter cities, earthquake prediction and control of autonomous vehicles. This tutorial will provide overview of streaming systems and hands on tutorial on building streaming analytics systems using open source technologies.",KDD
An Extensible Event Extraction System With Cross-Media Event Resolution,2018,"The automatic extraction of breaking news events from natural language text is a valuable capability for decision support systems. Traditional systems tend to focus on extracting events from a single media source and often ignore cross-media references. Here, we describe a large-scale automated system for extracting natural disasters and critical events from both newswire text and social media. We outline a comprehensive architecture that can identify, categorize and summarize seven different event types - namely floods, storms, fires, armed conflict, terrorism, infrastructure breakdown, and labour unavailability. The system comprises fourteen modules and is equipped with a novel coreference mechanism, capable of linking events extracted from the two complementary data sources. Additionally, the system is easily extensible to accommodate new event types. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the system.",KDD
Reconstructing an Epidemic Over Time,2016,"We consider the problem of reconstructing an epidemic over time, or, more general, reconstructing the propagation of an activity in a network. Our input consists of a temporal network, which contains information about when two nodes interacted, and a sample of nodes that have been reported as infected. The goal is to recover the flow of the spread, including discovering the starting nodes, and identifying other likely-infected nodes that are not reported. The problem we consider has multiple applications, from public health to social media and viral marketing purposes.
 Previous work explicitly factor-in many unrealistic assumptions: it is assumed that (a) the underlying network does not change;(b) we have access to perfect noise-free data; or (c) we know the exact propagation model. In contrast, we avoid these simplifications: we take into account the temporal network, we require only a small sample of reported infections, and we do not make any restrictive assumptions about the propagation model.
 We develop CulT, a scalable and effective algorithm to reconstruct epidemics that is also suited for online settings. CulT works by formulating the problem as that of a temporal Steiner-tree computation, for which we design a fast algorithm leveraging the specific problem structure. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach through extensive experiments on diverse datasets.",KDD
Blending Noisy Social Media Signals with Traditional Movement Variables to Predict Forced Migration,2019,"Worldwide displacement due to war and conflict is at all-time high. Unfortunately, determining if, when, and where people will move is a complex problem. This paper proposes integrating both publicly available organic data from social media and newspapers with more traditional indicators of forced migration to determine when and where people will move. We combine movement and organic variables with spatial and temporal variation within different Bayesian models and show the viability of our method using a case study involving displacement in Iraq. Our analysis shows that incorporating open-source generated conversation and event variables maintains or improves predictive accuracy over traditional variables alone. This work is an important step toward understanding how to leverage organic big data for societal--scale problems.",KDD
Instilling Social to Physical: Co-Regularized Heterogeneous Transfer Learning,2016,"Ubiquitous computing tasks, such as human activity recognition (HAR), are enabling a wide spectrum of applications, ranging from healthcare to environment monitoring. The success of a ubiquitous computing task relies on sufÃ¯Â¬Âcient physical sensor data with groundtruth labels, which are always scarce due to the expensive annotating process. Meanwhile, social media platforms provide a lot of social or semantic context information. People share what they are doing and where they are frequently in the messages they post. This rich set of socially shared activities motivates us to transfer knowledge from social media to address the sparsity issue of labelled physical sensor data. In order to transfer the knowledge of social and semantic context, we propose a Co-Regularized Heterogeneous Transfer Learning (CoHTL) model, which builds a common semantic space derived from two heterogeneous domains. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two ubiquitous computing tasks, namely human activity recognition and region function discovery.",AAAI
Reducing gang violence through network influence based targeting of social programs,2014,"In this paper, we study a variant of the social network maximum influence problem and its application to intelligently approaching individual gang members with incentives to leave a gang. The goal is to identify individuals who when influenced to leave gangs will propagate this action. We study this emerging application by exploring specific facets of the problem that must be addressed when modeling this particular situation. We formulate a new influence maximization variant - the ""social incentive influence"" (SII) problem and study it both formally and in the context of the law-enforcement domain. Using new techniques from unconstrained submodular maximization, we develop an approximation algorithm for SII and present a suite of experimental results - including tests on real-world police data from Chicago.",KDD
Discovering Latent Patterns of Urban Cultural Interactions in WeChat for Modern City Planning,2018,"Cultural activity is an inherent aspect of urban life and the success of a modern city is largely determined by its capacity to offer generous cultural entertainment to its citizens. To this end, the optimal allocation of cultural establishments and related resources across urban regions becomes of vital importance, as it can reduce financial costs in terms of planning and improve quality of life in the city, more generally. In this paper, we make use of a large longitudinal dataset of user location check-ins from the online social network WeChat to develop a data-driven framework for cultural planning in the city of Beijing. We exploit rich spatio-temporal representations on user activity at cultural venues and use a novel extended version of the traditional latent Dirichlet allocation model that incorporates temporal information to identify latent patterns of urban cultural interactions. Using the characteristic typologies of mobile user cultural activities emitted by the model, we determine the levels of demand for different types of cultural resources across urban areas. We then compare those with the corresponding levels of supply as driven by the presence and spatial reach of cultural venues in local areas to obtain high resolution maps that indicate urban regions with lack of cultural resources, and thus give suggestions for further urban cultural planning and investment optimisation.",KDD
LCARS: a location-content-aware recommender system,2013,"Newly emerging location-based and event-based social network services provide us with a new platform to understand users' preferences based on their activity history. A user can only visit a limited number of venues/events and most of them are within a limited distance range, so the user-item matrix is very sparse, which creates a big challenge for traditional collaborative filtering-based recommender systems. The problem becomes more challenging when people travel to a new city where they have no activity history.
 In this paper, we propose LCARS, a location-content-aware recommender system that offers a particular user a set of venues (e.g., restaurants) or events (e.g., concerts and exhibitions) by giving consideration to both personal interest and local preference. This recommender system can facilitate people's travel not only near the area in which they live, but also in a city that is new to them. Specifically, LCARS consists of two components: offline modeling and online recommendation. The offline modeling part, called LCA-LDA, is designed to learn the interest of each individual user and the local preference of each individual city by capturing item co-occurrence patterns and exploiting item contents. The online recommendation part automatically combines the learnt interest of the querying user and the local preference of the querying city to produce the top-k recommendations. To speed up this online process, a scalable query processing technique is developed by extending the classic Threshold Algorithm (TA). We evaluate the performance of our recommender system on two large-scale real data sets, DoubanEvent and Foursquare. The results show the superiority of LCARS in recommending spatial items for users, especially when traveling to new cities, in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.",KDD
A Collaborative Filtering Approach to Citywide Human Mobility Completion from Sparse Call Records,2016,"Most of human mobility big datasets available by now, for example call detail records or twitter data with geotag, are always sparse and heavily biased. As a result, using such kind of data to directly represent real-world human mobility is unreliable and problematic. However, difficult though it is, a completion of human mobility turns out to be a promising way to minimize the issues of sparsity and bias. In this paper, we model the completion problem as a recommender system and therefore solve this problem in a collaborative filtering (CF) framework. We propose a spatio-temporal CF that simultaneously infers the topic distribution over users, time-of-days, days as well as locations, and then use the topic distributions to estimate a posterior over locations and infer the optimal location sequence in a Hidden Markov Model considering the spatio-temporal continuity. We apply and evaluate our algorithm using a real-world Call Detail Records dataset from Bangladesh and gives an application on Dynamic Census, which incorporates the survey data from cell phone users to generate an hourly population distribution with attributes.",IJCAI
Deep Reinforcement Learning for Syntactic Error Repair in Student Programs,2019,"Novice programmers often struggle with the formal syntax of programming languages. In the traditional classroom setting, they can make progress with the help of real time feedback from their instructors which is often impossible to get in the massive open online course (MOOC) setting. Syntactic error repair techniques have huge potential to assist them at scale. Towards this, we design a novel programming language correction framework amenable to reinforcement learning. The framework allows an agent to mimic human actions for text navigation and editing. We demonstrate that the agent can be trained through self-exploration directly from the raw input, that is, program text itself, without either supervision or any prior knowledge of the formal syntax of the programming language. We evaluate our technique on a publicly available dataset containing 6975 erroneous C programs with typographic errors, written by students during an introductory programming course. Our technique fixes 1699 (24.4%) programs completely and 1310 (18.8%) program partially, outperforming DeepFix, a state-of-the-art syntactic error repair technique, which uses a fully supervised neural machine translation approach.",AAAI
"A Wiki with Multiagent Tracking, Modeling, and Coalition Formation",2010,"Wikis are being increasingly used as a tool for conducting colla-borative writing assignments in todayÃ¢â¬â¢s classrooms. However, Wikis in general (1) do not provide group formation methods to more specifically facilitate collaborative learning of the students and (2) suffer from typical problems of collaborative learning like detection of free-riding (earning credit without contribution). To improve the state of the art of the use of Wikis as a collaborative writing tool, we have designed and implemented ClassroomWiki - a Web-based collaborative Wiki that utilizes a set of learner pedagogy theories to provide multiagent-based tracking, modeling, and group formation functionalities. For the students, ClassroomWiki provides a Web interface for writing and revising their groupÃ¢â¬â¢s Wiki and a topic-based forum for discussing their ideas during collaboration. When the students collaborate, ClassroomWikiÃ¢â¬â¢s agents track all student activities to learn a model of the students and use a Bayesian Network to learn a probabilistic mapping that describes the ability of a group of students with a specific set of models to work together. For the teacher, Clas-sroomWiki provides a framework that uses the learned student models and the mapping to form student groups to improve the collaborative learning of students. ClassroomWiki was deployed in three university-level courses and the results suggest that ClassroomWiki can (1) form better student groups that improve stu-dent learning and collaboration and (2) alleviate free-riding and allow the instructor to provide scaffolding by its multiagent-based tracking and modeling.",AAAI
Probabilistic Latent Variable Modeling for Assessing Behavioral Influences on Well-Being,2019,"Health research has an increasing focus on promoting well-being and positive mental health, to prevent disease and to more effectively treat disorders. The availability of rich multi-modal datasets and advances in machine learning methods are now enabling data science research to begin to objectively assess well-being. However, most existing studies focus on detecting the current state or predicting the future state of well-being using stand-alone health behaviors. There is a need for methods that can handle a complex combination of health behaviors, as arise in real-world data.
 In this paper, we present a framework to 1) map multi-modal messy data collected in the ""wild"" to meaningful feature representations of health behavior, and 2) uncover latent patterns comprising multiple health behaviors that best predict well-being. We show how to use supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (sLDA) to model the observed behaviors, and we apply variational inference to uncover the latent patterns. Implementing and evaluating the model on 5,397 days of data from a group of 244 college students, we find that these latent patterns are indeed predictive of self-reported stress, one of the largest components affecting well-being. We investigate the modifiable behaviors present in these patterns and uncover some ways in which the factors work together to influence well-being. This work contributes a new method using objective data analysis to help individuals monitor their well-being using real-world measurements. Insights from this study advance scientific knowledge on how combinations of daily modifiable human behaviors relate to human well-being.",KDD
Spoken English Grading: Machine Learning with Crowd Intelligence,2015,"In this paper, we address the problem of grading spontaneous speech using a combination of machine learning and crowdsourcing. Traditional machine learning techniques solve the stated problem inadequately as automatic speaker-independent speech transcription is inaccurate. The features derived from it are also inaccurate and so is the machine learning model developed for speech evaluation. We propose a framework that combines machine learning with crowdsourcing. This entails identifying human intelligence tasks in the feature derivation step and using crowdsourcing to get them completed. We post the task of speech transcription to a large community of online workers (crowd). We also get spoken English grades from the crowd. We achieve 95% transcription accuracy by combining transcriptions from multiple crowd workers. Speech and prosody features are derived by force aligning the speech samples on these highly accurate transcriptions. Additionally, we derive surface and semantic level features directly from the transcription. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by predicting expert graded speech sample of 566 adult non-native speakers across two different countries - India and Philippines. Using the regression modeling technique, we are able achieve a Pearson correlation of 0.79 on the Philippines set and 0.74 on the Indian set with expert grades, an accuracy much higher than any previously reported machine learning approach. Our approach has an accuracy that rivals that of expert agreement. We show the value of the system through a case study in a real-world industrial deployment. This work is timely given the huge requirement of spoken English training and assessment.",KDD
Automated Geometry Theorem Proving for Human-Readable Proofs,2015,"Geometry reasoning and proof form a major and challenging component in the K-121 mathematics curriculum. Although several computerized systems exist that help students learn and practice general geometry concepts, they do not target geometry proof problems, which are more advanced and difficult. Powerful geometry theorem provers also exist, however they typically employ advanced algebraic methods and generate complex, difficult to understand proofs, and thus do not meet general K-12 studentsâ educational needs. This paper tackles these weaknesses of prior systems by introducing a geometry proof system, iGeoTutor, capable of generating human-readable elementary proofs, i.e. proofs using standard Euclidean axioms. We have gathered 77 problems in total from various sources, including ones unsolvable by other systems and from Math competitions. iGeoTutor solves all but two problems in under two minutes each, and more importantly, demonstrates a much more effective and intelligent proof search than prior systems. We have also conducted a pilot study with 12 high school students, and the results show that iGeoTutor provides a clear benefit in helping students learn geometry proofs. We are in active discussions with Khan Academy and local high schools for possible adoption of iGeo-Tutor in real learning environments.",IJCAI
Synthesis of Geometry Proof Problems,2014,"This paper presents a semi-automated methodology for generating geometric proof problems of the kind found in a high-school curriculum.

SPARC: Self-Paced Network Representation for Few-Shot Rare Category Characterization,2018,"In the era of big data, it is often the rare categories that are of great interest in many high-impact applications, ranging from financial fraud detection in online transaction networks to emerging trend detection in social networks, from network intrusion detection in computer networks to fault detection in manufacturing. As a result, rare category characterization becomes a fundamental learning task, which aims to accurately characterize the rare categories given limited label information. The unique challenge of rare category characterization, i.e., the non-separability nature of the rare categories from the majority classes, together with the availability of the multi-modal representation of the examples, poses a new research question: how can we learn a salient rare category oriented embedding representation such that the rare examples are well separated from the majority class examples in the embedding space, which facilitates the follow-up rare category characterization?
 To address this question, inspired by the family of curriculum learning that simulates the cognitive mechanism of human beings, we propose a self-paced framework named SPARC that gradually learns the rare category oriented network representation and the characterization model in a mutually beneficial way by shifting from the 'easy' concept to the target 'difficult' one, in order to facilitate more reliable label propagation to the large number of unlabeled examples. The experimental results on various real data demonstrate that our proposed SPARC algorithm: (1) shows a significant improvement over state-of-the-art graph embedding methods on representing the rare categories that are non-separable from the majority classes; (2) outperforms the existing methods on rare category characterization tasks.",KDD
Callisto: A Cryptographic Approach to Detecting Serial Perpetrators of Sexual Misconduct (NOTE),2018,"Sexual misconduct is prevalent in workplace and education settings but stigma and risk of further damage deter many victims from seeking justice. Callisto, a non-profit that has created an online sexual assault reporting platform for college campuses, is expanding its work to combat sexual assault and harassment in other industries. In this new product, users will be invited to an online ""matching escrow"" that will detect repeat perpetrators and create pathways to support for victims. Users submit encrypted data about their perpetrator, and this data can only be decrypted by the Callisto Options Counselor (a lawyer), when another user enters the identity of the same perpetrator. If the perpetrator identities match, both users will be put in touch independently with the Options Counselor, who will connect them to each other (if appropriate) and help them determine their best path towards justice. The client relationships with the Options Counselors are structured so that any client-counselor communications would be privileged. A combination of client-side encryption, encrypted communication channels, oblivious pseudo-random functions, key federation, and Shamir Secret Sharing keep data confidential in transit, at rest, and during the matching process with the guarantee that only the lawyer ever has access to user submitted data, and even then only when a match is identified.",COMPASS
MetaSeer.STEM:Towards Automating Meta-Analyses,2016,"Meta-analysis is a principled statistical approach for summarizing quantitative information reported across studies within a research domain of interest. Although the results of meta-analyses can be highly informative,the process of collecting and coding the data for a meta analysis is often a labor-intensive effort fraught with the potential for human error and idiosyncrasy. This is due to the fact that researchers typically spend weeks poring over published journal articles, technical reports, book chapters and other materials in order to retrieve key data elements that are then manually coded for subsequent analyses (e.g., descriptive statistics, effect sizes, reliability estimates, demographics, and study conditions).In this paper, we propose a machine learning based system developed to support automated extraction of data pertinent to STEM education meta-analyses, including educational and human resource initiatives aimed at improving achievement, literacy and interest in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.",AAAI
A Model-Free Affective Reinforcement Learning Approach to Personalization of an Autonomous Social Robot Companion for Early Literacy Education,2019,"Personalized education technologies capable of delivering adaptive interventions could play an important role in addressing the needs of diverse young learners at a critical time of school readiness. We present an innovative personalized social robot learning companion system that utilizes childrenÃ¢â¬â¢s verbal and nonverbal affective cues to modulate their engagement and maximize their long-term learning gains. We propose an affective reinforcement learning approach to train a personalized policy for each student during an educational activity where a child and a robot tell stories to each other. Using the personalized policy, the robot selects stories that are optimized for each childÃ¢â¬â¢s engagement and linguistic skill progression. We recruited 67 bilingual and English language learners between the ages of 4Ã¢â¬â6 years old to participate in a between-subjects study to evaluate our system. Over a three-month deployment in schools, a unique storytelling policy was trained to deliver a personalized story curriculum for each child in the Personalized group. We compared their engagement and learning outcomes to a Non-personalized group with a fixed curriculum robot, and a baseline group that had no robot intervention. In the Personalization condition, our results show that the affective policy successfully personalized to each child to boost their engagement and outcomes with respect to learning and retaining more target words as well as using more target syntax structures as compared to children in the other groups.",AAAI
Formative Essay Feedback Using Predictive Scoring Models,2017,"A major component of secondary education is learning to write effectively, a skill which is bolstered by repeated practice with formative guidance. However, providing focused feedback to every student on multiple drafts of each essay throughout the school year is a challenge for even the most dedicated of teachers. This paper first establishes a new ordinal essay scoring model and its state of the art performance compared to recent results in the Automated Essay Scoring field. Extending this model, we describe a method for using prediction on realistic essay variants to give rubric-specific formative feedback to writers. This method is used in Revision Assistant, a deployed data-driven educational product that provides immediate, rubric-specific, sentence-level feedback to students to supplement teacher guidance. We present initial evaluations of this feedback generation, both offline and in deployment.",KDD
Automated Grading of DFA constructions,2013,"One challenge in making online education more effective is to develop automatic grading software that can provide meaningful feedback. This paper provides a solution to automatic grading of the standard computation-theory problem that asks a student to construct a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) from the given description of its language. We focus on how to assign partial grades for incorrect answers. Each student's answer is compared to the correct DFA using a hybrid of three techniques devised to capture different classes of errors. First, in an attempt to catch syntactic mistakes, we compute the edit distance between the two DFA descriptions. Second, we consider the entropy of the symmetric difference of the languages of the two DFAs, and compute a score that estimates the fraction of the number of strings on which the student answer is wrong. Our third technique is aimed at capturing mistakes in reading of the problem description. For this purpose, we consider a description language Mosel, which adds syntactic sugar to the classical Monadic Second Order Logic, and allows defining regular languages in a concise and natural way. We provide algorithms, along with optimizations, for transforming Mosel descriptions into DFAs and vice-versa. These allow us to compute the syntactic edit distance of the incorrect answer from the correct one in terms of their logical representations. We report an experimental study that evaluates hundreds of answers submitted by (real) students by comparing grades/feedback computed by our tool with human graders. Our conclusion is that the tool is able to assign partial grades in a meaningful way, and should be preferred over the human graders for both scalability and consistency.",IJCAI
Methods for ordinal peer grading,2014,"Massive Online Open Courses have the potential to revolutionize higher education with their wide outreach and accessibility, but they require instructors to come up with scalable alternates to traditional student evaluation. Peer grading -- having students assess each other -- is a promising approach to tackling the problem of evaluation at scale, since the number of ""graders"" naturally scales with the number of students. However, students are not trained in grading, which means that one cannot expect the same level of grading skills as in traditional settings. Drawing on broad evidence that ordinal feedback is easier to provide and more reliable than cardinal feedback [5, 38, 29, 9], it is therefore desirable to allow peer graders to make ordinal statements (e.g. ""project X is better than project Y"") and not require them to make cardinal statements (e.g. ""project X is a B-""). Thus, in this paper we study the problem of automatically inferring student grades from ordinal peer feedback, as opposed to existing methods that require cardinal peer feedback. We formulate the ordinal peer grading problem as a type of rank aggregation problem, and explore several probabilistic models under which to estimate student grades and grader reliability. We study the applicability of these methods using peer grading data collected from a real class --- with instructor and TA grades as a baseline --- and demonstrate the efficacy of ordinal feedback techniques in comparison to existing cardinal peer grading methods. Finally, we compare these peer-grading techniques to traditional evaluation techniques.",KDD
Identifying At-Risk Students in Massive Open Online Courses,2015,"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have received widespread attention for their potential to scale higher education, with multiple platforms such as Coursera, edX and Udacity recently appearing. Despite their successes, a major problem faced by MOOCs is low completion rates. In this paper, we explore the accurate early identification of students who are at risk of not completing courses. We build predictive models weekly, over multiple offerings of a course. Furthermore, we envision student interventions that present meaningful probabilities of failure, enacted only for marginal students.To be effective, predicted probabilities must be both well-calibrated and smoothed across weeks.Based on logistic regression, we propose two transfer learning algorithms to trade-off smoothness and accuracy by adding a regularization term to minimize the difference of failure probabilities between consecutive weeks. Experimental results on two offerings of a Coursera MOOC establish the effectiveness of our algorithms.",AAAI
Exploring Student Check-In Behavior for Improved Point-of-Interest Prediction,2018,"With the availability of vast amounts of user visitation history on location-based social networks (LBSN), the problem of Point-of- Interest (POI) prediction has been extensively studied. However, much of the research has been conducted solely on voluntary check-in datasets collected from social apps such as Foursquare or Yelp. While these data contain rich information about recreational activities (e.g., restaurants, nightlife, and entertainment), information about more prosaic aspects of people's lives is sparse. is not only limits our understanding of users' daily routines, but more importantly the modeling assumptions developed based on characteristics of recreation-based data may not be suitable for richer check-in data. In this work, we present an analysis of education ""check-in"" data using WiFi access logs collected at Purdue University. We propose a heterogeneous graph-based method to encode the correlations between users, POIs, and activities, and then jointly learn embeddings for the vertices. We evaluate our method compared to previous state-of-the-art POI prediction methods, and show that the assumptions made by previous methods signicantly degrade performance on our data with dense(r) activity signals. We also show how our learned embeddings could be used to identify similar students (e.g., for friend suggestions).",KDD
Exercise-Enhanced Sequential Modeling for Student Performance Prediction,2018,"In online education systems, for offering proactive services to students (e.g., personalized exercise recommendation), a crucial demand is to predict student performance (e.g., scores) on future exercising activities. Existing prediction methods mainly exploit the historical exercising records of students, where each exercise is usually represented as the manually labeled knowledge concepts, and the richer information contained in the text description of exercises is still underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel Exercise-Enhanced Recurrent Neural Network (EERNN) framework for student performance prediction by taking full advantage of both student exercising records and the text of each exercise. Specifically, for modeling the student exercising process, we first design a bidirectional LSTM to learn each exercise representation from its text description without any expertise and information loss. Then, we propose a new LSTM architecture to trace student states (i.e., knowledge states) in their sequential exercising process with the combination of exercise representations. For making final predictions, we design two strategies under EERNN, i.e., EERNNM with Markov property and EERNNA with Attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on large-scale real-world data clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of EERNN framework. Moreover, by incorporating the exercise correlations, EERNN can well deal with the cold start problems from both student and exercise perspectives.",AAAI
Optimally Discriminative Choice Sets in Discrete Choice Models: Application to Data-Driven Test Design,2016,"Difficult multiple-choice (MC) questions can be made easy by providing a set of answer options of which most are obviously wrong. In the education literature, a plethora of instructional guides exist for crafting a suitable set of wrong choices (distractors) that enable the assessment of the students' understanding. The art of MC question design thus hinges on the question-maker's experience and knowledge of the potential misconceptions. In contrast, we advocate a data-driven approach, where correct and incorrect options are assembled directly from the students' own past submissions. Large-scale online classroom settings, such as massively open online courses (MOOCs), provide an opportunity to design optimal and adaptive multiple-choice questions that are maximally informative about the students' level of understanding of the material. In this work, we (i) develop a multinomial-logit discrete choice model for the setting of MC testing, (ii) derive an optimization objective for selecting optimally discriminative option sets, (iii) propose an algorithm for finding a globally-optimal solution, and (iv) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach via synthetic experiments and a user study. We finally showcase an application of our approach to crowd-sourcing tests from technical online forums.",KDD
Question Difficulty Prediction for READING Problems in Standard Tests,2017,"Standard tests aim to evaluate the performance of examinees using different tests with consistent difficulties. Thus, a critical demand is to predict the difficulty of each test question before the test is conducted. Existing studies are usually based on the judgments of education experts (e.g., teachers), which may be subjective and labor intensive. In this paper, we propose a novel Test-aware Attention-based Convolutional Neural Network (TACNN) framework to automatically solve this Question Difficulty Prediction (QDP) task for READING problems (a typical problem style in English tests) in standard tests. Specifically, given the abundant historical test logs and text materials of questions, we first design a CNN-based architecture to extract sentence representations for the questions. Then, we utilize an attention strategy to qualify the difficulty contribution of each sentence to questions. Considering the incomparability of question difficulties in different tests, we propose a test-dependent pairwise strategy for training TACNN and generating the difficulty prediction value. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset not only show the effectiveness of TACNN, but also give interpretable insights to track the attention information for questions.",AAAI
Automatically Generating Problems and Solutions for Natural Deduction,2013,"Natural deduction, which is a method for establishing validity of propositional type arguments, helps develop important reasoning skills and is thus a key ingredient in a course on introductory logic. We present two core components, namely solution generation and practice problem generation, for enabling computer-aided education for this important subject domain. The key enabling technology is use of an offline-computed data-structure called Universal Proof Graph (UPG) that encodes all possible applications of inference rules over all small propositions abstracted using their bitvector-based truth-table representation. This allows an efficient forward search for solution generation. More interestingly, this allows generating fresh practice problems that have given solution characteristics by performing a backward search in UPG. We obtained around 300 natural deduction problems from various textbooks. Our solution generation procedure can solve many more problems than the traditional forward-chaining based procedure, while our problem generation procedure can efficiently generate several variants with desired characteristics.",IJCAI
Simultaneous Urban Region Function Discovery and Popularity Estimation via an Infinite Urbanization Process Model,2018,"Urbanization is a global trend that we have all witnessed in the past decades. It brings us both opportunities and challenges. On the one hand, urban system is one of the most sophisticated social-economic systems that is responsible for efficiently providing supplies meeting the demand of residents in various of domains, e.g., dwelling, education, entertainment, healthcare, etc. On the other hand, significant diversity and inequality exist in the development patterns of urban systems, which makes urban data analysis difficult. Different urban regions often exhibit diverse urbanization patterns and provide distinct urban functions, e.g., commercial and residential areas offer significantly different urban functions. It is desired to develop the data analytic capabilities for discovering the underlying cross-domain urbanization patterns, clustering urban regions based on their function similarity and predicting region popularity in specified domains. Previous studies in the urban data analysis area often just focus on individual domains and rarely consider cross-domain urban development patterns hidden in different urban regions. In this paper, we propose the infinite urbanization process (IUP) model for simultaneous urban region function discovery and region popularity prediction. The IUP model is a generative Bayesian nonparametric process that is capable of describing a potentially infinite number of urbanization patterns. It is developed within the supervised topic modelling framework and is supported by a novel hierarchical spatial distance dependent Bayesian nonparametric prior over the spatial region partition space. The empirical study conducted on the real-world datasets shows promising outcome compared with the state-of-the-art techniques.",KDD
Zero Shot Learning for Code Education: Rubric Sampling with Deep Learning Inference,2019,"In modern computer science education, massive open online courses (MOOCs) log thousands of hours of data about how students solve coding challenges. Being so rich in data, these platforms have garnered the interest of the machine learning community, with many new algorithms attempting to autonomously provide feedback to help future students learn. But what about those first hundred thousand students? In most educational contexts (i.e. classrooms), assignments do not have enough historical data for supervised learning. In this paper, we introduce a human-in-the-loop Ã¢â¬Årubric samplingÃ¢â¬Â approach to tackle the Ã¢â¬Åzero shotÃ¢â¬Â feedback challenge. We are able to provide autonomous feedback for the first students working on an introductory programming assignment with accuracy that substantially outperforms data-hungry algorithms and approaches human level fidelity. Rubric sampling requires minimal teacher effort, can associate feedback with specific parts of a studentÃ¢â¬â¢s solution and can articulate a studentÃ¢â¬â¢s misconceptions in the language of the instructor. Deep learning inference enables rubric sampling to further improve as more assignment specific student data is acquired. We demonstrate our results on a novel dataset from Code.org, the worldÃ¢â¬â¢s largest programming education platform.",AAAI
QuesNet: A Unified Representation for Heterogeneous Test Questions,2019,"Understanding learning materials (e.g. test questions) is a crucial issue in online learning systems, which can promote many applications in education domain. Unfortunately, many supervised approaches suffer from the problem of scarce human labeled data, whereas abundant unlabeled resources are highly underutilized. To alleviate this problem, an effective solution is to use pre-trained representations for question understanding. However, existing pre-training methods in NLP area are infeasible to learn test question representations due to several domain-specific characteristics in education. First, questions usually comprise of heterogeneous data including content text, images and side information. Second, there exists both basic linguistic information as well as domain logic and knowledge. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel pre-training method, namely QuesNet, for comprehensively learning question representations. Specifically, we first design a unified framework to aggregate question information with its heterogeneous inputs into a comprehensive vector. Then we propose a two-level hierarchical pre-training algorithm to learn better understanding of test questions in an unsupervised way. Here, a novel holed language model objective is developed to extract low-level linguistic features, and a domain-oriented objective is proposed to learn high-level logic and knowledge. Moreover, we show that QuesNet has good capability of being fine-tuned in many question-based tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale real-world question data, where the experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of QuesNet for question understanding as well as its superior applicability.",KDD
GRADE: Machine Learning Support for Graduate Admissions,2013,"This paper describes GRADE, a statistical machine learning system developed to support the work of the graduate admissions committee at the University of Texas at Austin Department of Computer Science (UTCS). In recent years, the number of applications to the UTCS PhD program has become too large to manage with a traditional review process. GRADE uses historical admissions data to predict how likely the committee is to admit each new applicant. It reports each prediction as a score similar to those used by human reviewers, and accompanies each by an explanation of what applicant features most influenced its prediction. GRADE makes the review process more efficient by enabling reviewers to spend most of their time on applicants near the decision boundary and by focusing their attention on parts of each applicantÃ¢â¬â¢s file that matter the most. An evaluation over two seasons of PhD admissions indicates that the system leads to dramatic time savings, reducing the total time spent on reviews by at least 74%.",AAAI
The Diverse Cohort Selection Problem (Page 601),2019,"How should a firm allocate its limited interviewing resources to select the optimal cohort of new employees from a large set of job applicants? How should that firm allocate cheap but noisy resume screenings and expensive but in-depth in-person interviews? We view this problem through the lens of combinatorial pure exploration (CPE) in the multi-armed bandit setting, where a central learning agent performs costly exploration of a set of arms before selecting a final subset with some combinatorial structure. We generalize a recent CPE algorithm to the setting where arm pulls can have different costs and return different levels of information. We then prove theoretical upper bounds for a general class of arm-pulling strategies in this new setting. We apply our general algorithm to a real-world problem with combinatorial structure: incorporating diversity into university admissions. We take real data from admissions at one of the largest US-based computer science graduate programs and show that a simulation of our algorithm produces a cohort with hiring overall utility while spending comparable budget to the current admissions process at that university.",AAMAS
Interpreting Written How-To Instructions,2009,"Written instructions are a common way of teaching people how to accomplish tasks on the web.However, studies have shown that written instructions are difficult to follow, even for experienced users.A system that understands human-written instructions could guide users through the process of following the directions, improving completion rates and enhancing the user experience.While general natural language understanding is extremely difficult, we believe that in the limited domain of how-to instructions it should be possible to understand enough to provide guided help in a mixed-initiative environment.Based on a qualitative analysis of instructions gathered for 43 web-based tasks, we have formalized the problem of understanding and interpreting how-to instructions.We compare three different approaches to interpreting instructions: a keyword-based interpreter, a grammar-based interpreter, and an interpreter based on machine learning and information extraction.Our empirical results demonstrate the feasibility of automated how-to instruction understanding.",IJCAI
A Case Study of AI Application on Language Instruction: CSIEC,2008,"CSIEC (Computer Simulation in Educational Communication), is not only an intelligent web-based human-computer dialogue system with natural language for English instruction, but also a learning assessment system for learners and teachers. Its multiple functions including grammar gap filling exercises, talk show, free chatting and chatting on a given topic, can satisfy the various needs from the students with different backgrounds and learning abilities. After the brief explanation of the motivation and the survey of the related works, we illustrate the system structure, and describe its pedagogical functions with the underlying AI techniques in details such as NLP and human-computer interaction. We summarize the free Internet usage from a six months period and its integration into English classes in universities and middle schools. The evaluation findings show that the chatting function has been improved and frequently utilized by the users, and the application of the CSIEC system on English instruction can motivate the learners to practice English and enhance their learning process. Finally, we draw some conclusions for the future improvement.",AAAI
Automatic malware categorization using cluster ensemble,2010,"In this paper, resting on the analysis of instruction frequency and function-based instruction sequences, we develop an Automatic Malware Categorization System (AMCS) for automatically grouping malware samples into families that share some common characteristics using a cluster ensemble by aggregating the clustering solutions generated by different base clustering algorithms. We propose a principled cluster ensemble framework for combining individual clustering solutions based on the consensus partition. The domain knowledge in the form of sample-level constraints can be naturally incorporated in the ensemble framework. In addition, to account for the characteristics of feature representations, we propose a hybrid hierarchical clustering algorithm which combines the merits of hierarchical clustering and k-medoids algorithms and a weighted subspace K-medoids algorithm to generate base clusterings. The categorization results of our AMCS system can be used to generate signatures for malware families that are useful for malware detection. The case studies on large and real daily malware collection from Kingsoft Anti-Virus Lab demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our AMCS system.",KDD
"Lessons from El Paquete, Cubaâs Offline Internet",2018,"Cuba has one of the highest rates of literacy and education in the world, but also one of the lowest rates of direct Internet access. As a result, Cubans have developed a unique and robust offline system for distributing digital content through removable storage media like USB thumb drives and portable hard drives called El Paquete Semanal (The Weekly Package). In this paper, we describe and analyze the contents of El Paquete and how those contents vary over time and between distributors. We compare it to a less-popular state sponsored alternative called La Mochila (The Backpack) and discuss their respective distribution systems. We also compare these offline content distribution systems to available online access points such as those in public WiFi parks, tourist hotels, and universities. Finally, we reflect on how this system, developed in the Cuban context, could be useful in other environments.",COMPASS
Learning From African Classroom Pedagogy To Increase Student Engagement In Education Technologies,2019,"Tablet-based educational technologies provide a supplement to traditional classroom-based early literacy education, especially in regions with limited schooling resources. Prior work has probed how children generally interact with and learn from these technologies, however, there is limited research on student engagement with applications that utilize valuable input techniques such as automatic handwriting and speech recognition. In our study, we designed and field-tested early literacy speech and handwriting recognition applications with the primary aim of maximizing student engagement. We designed the applications based on prior research insights and classroom observations from our target population and field-tested the applications with 283 children living in rural Tanzania. We found that observing a small set of classrooms can produce design insights that increase engagement on tablet-based learning systems on a much larger scale. We also demonstrate the importance of domain familiarity in students' choice to persist through activities while learning with technology.",COMPASS
Designing Appropriate Learning Technologies for School vs. Home Settings in Tanzanian Rural Villages,2018,"Smartphone- and tablet-based learning systems are often posited as solutions for closing early literacy gaps between rural and urban regions in emerging economies. These systems are often developed based on experiences with students in urban contexts, limiting their success rates with children from rural areas who have had little to no prior exposure to technology. To explore how such technologies are used in different learning contexts, we deployed an early literacy learning application in school and home settings in a rural village in Tanzania. We use Rogoff's theory of instructional models to understand and describe the interaction between learners, adults, and peers. We found that in the presence of a school teacher, the instructional model was primarily ""adult-run"" where information was almost entirely disseminated by the teacher, while in home settings, the instructional model was similar to a ""community-of-learners"" model where children collaborate with other peers and adults to achieve their learning goals. We use these instructional models to surface six themes of support and scaffolding that were expressed differently across settings, and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of the instructional models observed in providing support across these themes.",COMPASS
Towards Knowledge Discovery from the Vatican Secret Archives. In Codice Ratio - Episode 1: Machine Transcription of the Manuscripts.,2018,"In Codice Ratio is a research project to study tools and techniques for analyzing the contents of historical documents conserved in the Vatican Secret Archives (VSA). In this paper, we present our efforts to develop a system to support the transcription of medieval manuscripts. The goal is to provide paleographers with a tool to reduce their efforts in transcribing large volumes, as those stored in the VSA, producing good transcriptions for significant portions of the manuscripts. We propose an original approach based on character segmentation. Our solution is able to deal with the dirty segmentation that inevitably occurs in handwritten documents. We use a convolutional neural network to recognize characters, and statistical language models to compose word transcriptions. Our approach requires minimal training effort, making the transcription process more scalable, as the production of training sets requires a few pages and can be easily crowdsourced. We have conducted experiments on manuscripts from the Vatican Registers, an unreleased corpus containing the correspondence of the popes. With training data produced by 120 high school students, our system has been able to produce good transcriptions that can be used by paleographers as a solid basis to speedup the transcription process at a large scale.",KDD
The Deployment of a Constraint-Based Dental School Timetabling System,2013,"We describe a constraint-based timetabling system that was developed for the dental school based at Cork University Hospital in Ireland.This system has been deployed since 2010.Dental school timetabling differs from other university course scheduling in that certain clinic sessions can be used by multiple courses at the same time, provided a limit on room capacity is satisfied.Starting from a constraint programming solution using a web interface, we have moved to a mixed integer programming-based solver to deal with multiple objectivefunctions, along with a dedicated Java application, which provides a rich user interface.Solutions for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012 have been used in the dental school, replacing a manual timetabling process, which could no longer cope with increasing student numbers and resulting resource bottlenecks.The use of the automated system allowed the dental school to increase student numbers to the maximum possible given the available resources.It also provides the school with a valuable ""what-if"" analysis tool.",AAAI
The Law of Choice and the Decision Not to Decide,2008,"Public school choice at the primary and secondary levels is one of the key elements of the U.S. No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB). If a school does not meet assessment goals for two consecutive years, by law the district must offer students the opportunity to transfer to a school that is meeting its goals. Making a choice with such potential impact on a child's future is clearly monumental, yet astonishingly few parents take advantage of the opportunity. Our research has shown that a significant part of the problem arises from issues in information access and information overload, particularly for low socioeconomic status families. We have developed an online application, called SmartChoice, to provide parents with school recommendations for individual students based on parents' preferences and students' needs, interests, abilities, and talents. The application employs content-based recommender systems techniques to generate a personalized list of schools that have a demonstrated track record with children who share a child's interests, skills, and needs. The first version of the application is deployed and live for focus group participants who have been using it for the January and March/April 2008 Charlotte-Mecklenburg school choice periods.",AAAI
A Machine Learning Framework to Identify Students at Risk of Adverse Academic Outcomes,2015,"Many school districts have developed successful intervention programs to help students graduate high school on time. However, identifying and prioritizing students who need those interventions the most remains challenging. This paper describes a machine learning framework to identify such students, discusses features that are useful for this task, applies several classification algorithms, and evaluates them using metrics important to school administrators. To help test this framework and make it practically useful, we partnered with two U.S. school districts with a combined enrollment of approximately 200,000 students. We together designed several evaluation metrics to assess the goodness of machine learning algorithms from an educator's perspective. This paper focuses on students at risk of not finishing high school on time, but our framework lays a strong foundation for future work on other adverse academic outcomes.",KDD
Siskin: Leveraging the Browser to Share Web Content in Disconnected Environments,2018,"Schools in the developing world frequently do not have high bandwidth or reliable connections, limiting their access to web content. As a result, schools are increasingly turning to Offline Educational Resources (OERs), employing purpose-built local hardware to serve content. These approaches can be expensive and difficult to maintain in resource-constrained settings. We present Siskin, an alternative approach that leverages the ubiquity of the web browser to provide a distributed content access cache between user devices on the lo-cal network. We demonstrate that this system allows access to web pages offline by identifying the browser as a ubiquitous platform. We build and evaluate a prototype, showing that existing web protocols and infrastructure can be leveraged to create a powerful content cache over a local network.",COMPASS
Learning from crowds in the presence of schools of thought,2012,"Crowdsourcing has recently become popular among machine learning researchers and social scientists as an effective way to collect large-scale experimental data from distributed workers. To extract useful information from the cheap but potentially unreliable answers to tasks, a key problem is to identify reliable workers as well as unambiguous tasks. Although for objective tasks that have one correct answer per task, previous works can estimate worker reliability and task clarity based on the single gold standard assumption, for tasks that are subjective and accept multiple reasonable answers that workers may be grouped into, a phenomenon called schools of thought, existing models cannot be trivially applied. In this work, we present a statistical model to estimate worker reliability and task clarity without resorting to the single gold standard assumption. This is instantiated by explicitly characterizing the grouping behavior to form schools of thought with a rank-1 factorization of a worker-task groupsize matrix. Instead of performing an intermediate inference step, which can be expensive and unstable, we present an algorithm to analytically compute the sizes of different groups. We perform extensive empirical studies on real data collected from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our method discovers the schools of thought, shows reasonable estimation of worker reliability and task clarity, and is robust to hyperparameter changes. Furthermore, our estimated worker reliability can be used to improve the gold standard prediction for objective tasks.",KDD
A Study of Educational Data Mining: Evidence from a Thai University,2019,"Educational data mining provides a way to predict student academic performance. A psychometric factor like time management is one of the major issues affecting Thai studentsÃ¢â¬â¢ academic performance. Current data sources used to predict studentsÃ¢â¬â¢ performance are limited to the manual collection of data or data from a single unit of study which cannot be generalised to indicate overall academic performance. This study uses an additional data source from a university log file to predict academic performance. It investigates the browsing categories and the Internet access activities of students with respect to their time management during their studies. A single source of data is insufficient to identify those students who are at-risk of failing in their academic studies. Furthermore, there is a paucity of recent empirical studies in this area to provide insights into the relationship between studentsÃ¢â¬â¢ academic performance and their Internet access activities. To contribute to this area of research, we employed two datasets such as web-browsing categories and Internet access activity types to select the best outcomes, and compared different weights in the time and frequency domains. We found that the random forest technique provides the best outcome in these datasets to identify those students who are at-risk of failure. We also found that data from their Internet access activities reveals more accurate outcomes than data from browsing categories alone. The combination of two datasets reveals a better picture of studentsÃ¢â¬â¢ Internet usage and thus identifies students who are academically at-risk of failure. Further work involves collecting more Internet access log file data, analysing it over a longer period and relating the period of data collection with events during the academic year.",AAAI
Learning Latent Engagement Patterns of Students in Online Courses,2014,"Maintaining and cultivating student engagement is critical for learning. Understanding factors affecting student engagement will help in designing better courses and improving student retention. The large number of participants in massive open online courses (MOOCs) and data collected from their interaction with the MOOC open up avenues for studying student engagement at scale. In this work, we develop a framework for modeling and understanding student engagement in online courses based on student behavioral cues. Our first contribution is the abstraction of student engagement types using latent representations and using that in a probabilistic model to connect student behavior with course completion. We demonstrate that the latent formulation for engagement helps in predicting student survival across three MOOCs. Next, in order to initiate better instructor interventions, we need to be able to predict student survival early in the course. We demonstrate that we can predict student survival early in the course reliably using the latent model. Finally, we perform a closer quantitative analysis of user interaction with the MOOC and identify student activities that are good indicators for survival at different points in the course.",AAAI
MOOCs Meet Measurement Theory: A Topic-Modelling Approach,2016,"This paper adapts topic models to the psychometric testing of MOOC students based on their online forum postings. Measurement theory from education and psychology provides statistical models for quantifying a person's attainment of intangible attributes such as attitudes, abilities or intelligence. Such models infer latent skill levels by relating them to individuals' observed responses on a series of items such as quiz questions. The set of items can be used to measure a latent skill if individuals' responses on them conform to a Guttman scale. Such well-scaled items differentiate between individuals and inferred levels span the entire range from most basic to the advanced. In practice, education researchers manually devise items (quiz questions) while optimising well-scaled conformance. Due to the costly nature and expert requirements of this process, psychometric testing has found limited use in everyday teaching. We aim to develop usable measurement models for highly-instrumented MOOC delivery platforms, by using participation in automatically-extracted online forum topics as items. The challenge is to formalise the Guttman scale educational constraint and incorporate it into topic models. To favour topics that automatically conform to a Guttman scale, we introduce a novel regularisation into non-negative matrix factorisation-based topic modelling. We demonstrate the suitability of our approach with both quantitative experiments on three Coursera MOOCs, and with a qualitative survey of topic interpretability on two MOOCs by domain expert interviews.",AAAI
Modeling professional similarity by mining professional career trajectories,2014,"For decades large corporations as well as labor placement services have maintained extensive yet static resume databanks. Online professional networks like LinkedIn have taken these resume databanks to a dynamic, constantly updated and massive scale professional profile dataset spanning career records from hundreds of industries, millions of companies and hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Using this professional profile dataset, this paper attempts to model profiles of individuals as a sequence of positions held by them as a time-series of nodes, each of which represents one particular position or job experience in the individual's career trajectory. These career trajectory models can be employed in various utility applications including career trajectory planning for students in schools & universities using knowledge inferred from real world career outcomes. They can also be employed for decoding sequences to uncover paths leading to certain professional milestones from a user's current professional status. We deploy the proposed technique to ascertain professional similarity between two individuals by developing a similarity measure SimCareers (Similar Career Paths). The measure employs sequence alignment between two career trajectories to quantify professional similarity between career paths. To the best of our knowledge, SimCareers is the first framework to model professional similarity between two people taking account their career trajectory information. We posit, that using the temporal and structural features of a career trajectory for modeling profile similarity is a far more superior approach than using similarity measures on semi-structured attribute representation of a profile for this application. We validate our hypothesis by extensive quantitative evaluations on a gold dataset of similar profiles generated from recruiting activity logs from actual recruiters using LinkedIn. In addition, we show significant improvements in engagement by running an A/B test on a real-world application called Similar Profiles on LinkedIn, world's largest online professional network.",KDD
Clustering Hand-Drawn Sketches via Analogical Generalization,2013,"One of the major challenges to building intelligent educational software is determining what kinds of feedback to give learners. Useful feedback makes use of models of domain-specific knowledge, especially models that are commonly held by potential students. To empirically determine what these models are, student data can be clustered to reveal common misconceptions or common problem-solving strategies. This paper describes how analogical retrieval and generalization can be used to cluster automatically analyzed hand-drawn sketches incorporating both spatial and conceptual information. We use this approach to cluster a corpus of hand-drawn student sketches to discover common answers. Common answer clusters can be used for the design of targeted feedback and for assessment.",AAAI

Existing methods are either based on temporal latent variable models, or factor analysis with temporal features. We here show that factorization machines (FMs), a model for regression or classification, encompasses several existing models in the educational literature as special cases, notably additive factor model, performance factor model, and multidimensional item response theory. We show, using several real datasets of tens of thousands of users and items, that FMs can estimate student knowledge accurately and fast even when student data is sparsely observed, and handle side information such as multiple knowledge components and number of attempts at item or skill level. Our approach allows to fit student models of higher dimension than existing models, and provides a testbed to try new combinations of features in order to improve existing models.",AAAI
Algorithmic Exam Generation,2015,"Given a class of students, and a pool of questions in the domain of study, what subset will constitute a good exam? Millions of educators are dealing with this difficult problem worldwide, yet exams are still composed manually in non-systematic ways. In this work we present a novel algorithmic framework for exam composition. Our framework requires two input components: a student population represented by a distribution over overlay models, each consisting of a set of mastered abilities, or actions; and a target model ordering that, given any two student models, defines which should be given the higher grade. To determine the performance of a student model on a potential question, we test whether it satisfies a disjunctive action landmark, i.e., whether its abilities are sufficient to follow at least one solution path. We present a novel utility function for evaluating exams, using the described components. An exam is highly evaluated if it is expected to order the student population with high correlation to the target order.The merit of our algorithmic framework is exemplified with real auto-generated questions in the domain of middle-school algebra.",IJCAI
"Hardware, Apps, And Surveys At Scale: Measuring Low-Voltage Grid Reliability In Accra, Ghana",2019,"The vision of sensor systems that collect critical and previously ungathered information about the world is often only realized when sensors, students, and subjects move outside the academic laboratory. However, deployments at even the smallest scales introduce complexities and risks that can be difficult for a research team to anticipate. Over the past year, our interdisciplinary team of engineers and economists has been designing, deploying, and operating a large sensor network in Accra, Ghana that measures power outages and quality at households and firms. This network consists of 457 custom sensors, over 3,000 mobile app instances, thousands of participant surveys, and custom user incentive and deployment management systems. In part, this deployment supports an evaluation of the impacts of investments in the grid on reliability and the subsequent effects of improvements in reliability on socioeconomic well-being. We report our experiences as we move from performing small pilot deployments to our current scale, attempting to identify the pain points at each stage of the deployment. Finally, we extract high-level observations and lessons learned from our deployment activities, which we wish we had originally known when forecasting budgets, human resources, and project timelines. These insights will be critical as we look toward scaling our deployment to the entire city of Accra and beyond, and we hope that they will encourage and support other researchers looking to measure highly granular information about our world's critical systems.",COMPASS
DeepFix: Fixing Common C Language Errors by Deep Learning,2017,"The problem of automatically fixing programming errors is a very active research topic in software engineering. This is a challenging problem as fixing even a single error may require analysis of the entire program. In practice, a number of errors arise due to programmer's inexperience with the programming language or lack of attention to detail. We call these common programming errors. These are analogous to grammatical errors in natural languages. Compilers detect such errors, but their error messages are usually inaccurate. In this work, we present an end-to-end solution, called DeepFix, that can fix multiple such errors in a program without relying on any external tool to locate or fix them. At the heart of DeepFix is a multi-layered sequence-to-sequence neural network with attention which is trained to predict erroneous program locations along with the required correct statements. On a set of 6971 erroneous C programs written by students for 93 programming tasks, DeepFix could fix 1881 (27%) programs completely and 1338 (19%) programs partially.",AAAI
Probabilistic Graphical Models for Boosting Cardinal and Ordinal Peer Grading in MOOCs,2015,"With the enormous scale of massive open online courses (MOOCs), peer grading is vital for addressing the assessment challenge for open-ended assignments or exams while at the same time providing students with an effective learning experience through involvement in the grading process. Most existing MOOC platforms use simple schemes for aggregating peer grades, e.g., taking the median or mean. To enhance these schemes, some recent research attempts have developed machine learning methods under either the cardinal setting (for absolute judgment) or the ordinal setting (for relative judgment). In this paper, we seek to study both cardinal and ordinal aspects of peer grading within a common framework. First, we propose novel extensions to some existing probabilistic graphical models for cardi- nal peer grading. Not only do these extensions give su- perior performance in cardinal evaluation, but they also outperform conventional ordinal models in ordinal eval- uation. Next, we combine cardinal and ordinal models by augmenting ordinal models with cardinal predictions as prior. Such combination can achieve further performance boosts in both cardinal and ordinal evaluations, suggesting a new research direction to pursue for peer grading on MOOCs. Extensive experiments have been conducted using real peer grading data from a course called Ã¢â¬ÅScience, Technology, and Society in China IÃ¢â¬Â offered by HKUST on the Coursera platform.",AAAI
Ranking Universities Based on Career Outcomes of Graduates,2016,"Every year, millions of new students enter higher educational programs. Publicly available rankings of academic programs play a key role in prospective students' decisions regarding which universities to apply to and enroll in. While surveys indicate that majority of freshmen enter college to get good jobs after graduation, established methodologies for ranking universities rely on indirect indicators of career outcomes such as reputational assessments of the universities among academic peers, acceptance and graduation rates, learning environment, and availability of research funding. In addition, many of these methodologies rely on arbitrary choices of weighting factors for the different ranking indicators, and suffer from lack of analyses of statistical stability. In this paper, we addresses these challenges holistically by developing a novel methodology for ranking and recommending universities for different professions on the basis of career outcomes of professionals who graduated from those schools. Our methodology incorporates a number of techniques for achieving statistical stability, and represents a step towards personalized educational recommendations based on interests and ambitions of individuals. We have applied this methodology on LinkedIn's Economic Graph data of over 400 million professional from around the world. The resulting university rankings have been made available to the public and demonstrate that there are valuable insights to be gleaned from professional career data on LinkedIn.",KDD
Dimensionally Guided Synthesis of Mathematical Word Problems,2016,"Mathematical Word Problems (MWPs) are important for training students' literacy and numeracy skills. Traditionally MWPs have been manually designed; an effective automated MWP generator can significantly benefit education and research. The goal of this work is to efficiently synthesize MWPs that are authentic (i.e., similar to manually written problems), diverse (i.e., covering a wide range of mathematical tasks), and configurable (i.e., varying difficulty levels and solution characteristics). This is challenging because a generated problem needs to both exhibit a well-founded mathematical structure and also an easily understood natural language story. Our key insight is to leverage the important role that dimensional units play in MWPs, both textually and symbolically. We first synthesize a dimensionally consistent equation and then compose the natural language story via a bottom-up traversal of the equation tree. We have realized our technique and extensively evaluated its efficiency and effectiveness. Results show that the system can generate hundreds of valid problems per second with varying levels of difficulty. More importantly, we show, via a user study with 30 students from a local middle school, that the generated problems are statistically indistinguishable from actual textbook problems for practice and examination.",IJCAI
The Quest Draft: An Automated Course Allocation Algorithm,2014,"Course allocation is one of the most complex issues facing any university, due to the sensitive nature of deciding which subset of students should be granted seats in highly-popular (market-scarce) courses. In recent years, researchers have proposed numerous solutions, using techniques in integer programming, combinatorial auction design, and matching theory. In this paper, we present a four-part AI-based course allocation algorithm that was conceived by an undergraduate student, and recently implemented at a small Canadian liberal arts university. This new allocation process, which builds upon the Harvard Business School Draft, has received overwhelming support from students and faculty for its transparency, impartiality, and effectiveness.",AAAI
PittGrub: A Frustration-Free System to Reduce Food Waste by Notifying Hungry College Students,2018,"The amount of food waste generated by the U.S. is staggering, both expensive in economic cost and environmental side effects. Surplus food, which could be used to feed people facing food insecurity, is instead discarded and placed in landfills. Institutions, universities, and non-profits have noticed this issue and are beginning to take action to reduce surplus food waste, typically by redirecting it to food banks and other organizations or having students transport or eat the food. These approaches present challenges such as transportation, volunteer availability, and lack of prioritization of those in need. In this paper, we introduce PittGrub, a notification system to intelligently select users to invite to events that have leftover food. PittGrub was invented to help reduce food waste at the University of Pittsburgh. We use reinforcement learning to determine how many notifications to send out and a valuation model to determine whom to prioritize in the notifications. Our goal is to produce a system that prioritizes feeding students in need while simultaneously eliminating food waste and maintaining a fair distribution of notifications. As far as we are aware, PittGrub is unique in its approach to eliminating surplus food waste while striving for social good. We compare our proposed techniques to multiple baselines on simulated datasets to demonstrate effectiveness. Experimental results among various algorithms show promise in eliminating food waste while helping those facing food insecurity and treating users fairly. Our prototype is currently in beta and coming soon to the Apple App Store.",KDD
Policies to Optimize Work Performance and Thermal Safety in Exercising Humans,2013,"Emergency workers engaged in strenuous work in hot environments risk overheating and mission failure. We describe a real-time application that would reduce these risks in terms of a real-time thermal-work strain index (SI) estimator; and a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to compute optimal work rate policies. We examined the thermo-physiological responses of 14 experienced U.S. Army Ranger students (26ÃÂ±4 years 1.77ÃÂ±0.04 m; 78.3ÃÂ±7.3 kg) who participated in a strenuous 8 mile time-restricted pass/fail road march conducted under thermally stressful conditions. A thermoregulatory model was used to derive SI state transition probabilities and model the studentsÃ¢â¬â¢ observed and policy driven movement rates. We found that policy end-state SI was significantly lower than SI when modeled using the studentÃ¢â¬â¢s own movement rates (3.94ÃÂ±0.88 vs. 5.62ÃÂ±1.20, P<0.001). We also found an inverse relationship between our policy impact and maximum SI (r=0.64 P<0.05). These results suggest that modeling real world missions as an MDP can provide optimal work rate policies that improve thermal safety and allow students to finish in a Ã¢â¬ÅfresherÃ¢â¬Â state. Ultimately, SI state estimation and MDP models incorporated into wearable physiological monitoring systems could provide real-time work rate guidance, thus minimizing thermal work-strain while maximizing the likelihood of accomplishing mission tasks.",AAAI
eRevise: Using Natural Language Processing to Provide Formative Feedback on Text Evidence Usage in Student Writing,2019,"Writing a good essay typically involves students revising an initial paper draft after receiving feedback. We present eRevise, a web-based writing and revising environment that uses natural language processing features generated for rubricbased essay scoring to trigger formative feedback messages regarding studentsÃ¢â¬â¢ use of evidence in response-to-text writing. By helping students understand the criteria for using text evidence during writing, eRevise empowers students to better revise their paper drafts. In a pilot deployment of eRevise in 7 classrooms spanning grades 5 and 6, the quality of text evidence usage in writing improved after students received formative feedback then engaged in paper revision.",AAAI
Predicting student risks through longitudinal analysis,2014,"Poor academic performance in K-12 is often a precursor to unsatisfactory educational outcomes such as dropout, which are associated with significant personal and social costs. Hence, it is important to be able to predict students at risk of poor performance, so that the right personalized intervention plans can be initiated. In this paper, we report on a large-scale study to identify students at risk of not meeting acceptable levels of performance in one state-level and one national standardized assessment in Grade 8 of a major US school district. An important highlight of our study is its scale - both in terms of the number of students included, the number of years and the number of features, which provide a very solid grounding to the research. We report on our experience with handling the scale and complexity of data, and on the relative performance of various machine learning techniques we used for building predictive models. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to predict students at-risk of poor assessment performance with a high degree of accuracy, and to do so well in advance. These insights can be used to pro-actively initiate personalized intervention programs and improve the chances of student success.",KDD
Synthesizing Pattern Programs from Examples,2018,"We describe a programming-by-example system that automatically generates pattern programs from examples. Writing pattern programs, which produce various patterns of characters, is one of the most popular programming exercises for entry-level students. However, students often find it difficult to write correct solutions by themselves. In this paper, we present a method for synthesizing pattern programs from examples, allowing students to improve their programming skills efficiently. To that end, we first design a domain-specific language that supports a large class of pattern programs that students struggle with. Next, we develop a synthesis algorithm that efficiently finds a desired program by combining enumerative search, constraint solving, and program analysis. We implemented the algorithm in a tool and evaluated it on 40 exercises gathered from online forums. The experimental results and user study show that our tool can synthesize instructive solutions from 1Ã¢â¬â3 example patterns in 1.2 seconds on average.",IJCAI
Progressive Prediction of Student Performance in College Programs,2017,"Accurately predicting students' future performance based on their tracked academic records in college programs is crucial for effectively carrying out necessary pedagogical interventions to ensure students' on-time graduation. Although there is a rich literature on predicting student performance in solving problems and studying courses using data-driven approaches, predicting student performance in completing college programs is much less studied and faces new challenges, mainly due to the diversity of courses selected by students and the requirement of continuous tracking and incorporation of students' evolving progresses. In this paper, we develop a novel algorithm that enables progressive prediction of students' performance by adapting ensemble learning techniques and utilizing education-specific domain knowledge. We prove its prediction performance guarantee and show its performance improvement against benchmark algorithms on a real-world student dataset from UCLA.",AAAI
Mechanix: A Sketch-Based Tutoring System for Statics Courses,2012,"Introductory engineering courses within large universities often have annual enrollments which can reach up to a thousand students. It is very challenging to achieve differentiated instruction in classrooms with class sizes and student diversity of such great magnitude. Professors can only assess whether students have mastered a concept by using multiple choice questions, while detailed homework assignments, such as planar truss diagrams, are rarely assigned because professors and teaching assistants would be too overburdened with grading to return assignments with valuable feedback in a timely manner. In this paper, we introduce Mechanix, a sketch-based deployed tutoring system for engineering students enrolled in statics courses. Our system not only allows students to enter planar truss and free body diagrams into the system just as they would with pencil and paper, but our system checks the student's work against a hand-drawn answer entered by the instructor, and then returns immediate and detailed feedback to the student. Students are allowed to correct any errors in their work and resubmit until the entire content is correct and thus all of the objectives are learned. Since Mechanix facilitates the grading and feedback processes, instructors are now able to assign free response questions, increasing teacher's knowledge of student comprehension. Furthermore, the iterative correction process allows students to learn during a test, rather than simply displaying memorized information.",AAAI
Grouping students in educational settings,2014,"Given a class of large number of students, each exhibiting a different ability level, how can we group them into sections so that the overall gain for students is maximized? This question has been a topic of central concern and debate amongst social scientists and policy makers for a long time. We propose a framework for rigorously studying this question, taking a computational perspective. We present a formal definition of the grouping problem and investigate some of its variants. Such variants are determined by the desired number of groups as well as the definition of the gain for each student in the group. We focus on two natural instantiations of the gain function and we show that for both of them the problem of identifying a single group of students that maximizes the gain among its members can be solved in polynomial time. The corresponding partitioning problem, where the goal is to partition the students into non-overlapping groups appear to be much harder. However, the algorithms for the single-group version can be leveraged for solving the more complex partitioning problem. Our experiments with generated data coming from different distributions demonstrate that our algorithm is significantly better than the current strategies in vogue for dividing students in a class into sections.",KDD
Retaining Privileged Information for Multi-Task Learning,2019,"Knowledge transfer has been of great interest in current machine learning research, as many have speculated its importance in modeling the human ability to rapidly generalize learned models to new scenarios. Particularly in cases where training samples are limited, knowledge transfer shows improvement on both the learning speed and generalization performance of related tasks. Recently, Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) has presented a new direction in knowledge transfer by modeling the transfer of prior knowledge as a Teacher-Student interaction process. Under LUPI, a Teacher model uses Privileged Information (PI) that is only available at training time to improve the sample complexity required to train a Student learner for a given task. In this work, we present a LUPI formulation that allows privileged information to be retained in a multi-task learning setting. We propose a novel feature matching algorithm that projects samples from the original feature space and the privilege information space into a joint latent space in a way that informs similarity between training samples. Our experiments show that useful knowledge from PI is maintained in the latent space and greatly improves the sample efficiency of other related learning tasks. We also provide an analysis of sample complexity of the proposed LUPI method, which under some favorable assumptions can achieve a greater sample efficiency than brute force methods.",KDD
Towards never-ending learning from time series streams,2013,"Time series classification has been an active area of research in the data mining community for over a decade, and significant progress has been made in the tractability and accuracy of learning. However, virtually all work assumes a one-time training session in which labeled examples of all the concepts to be learned are provided. This assumption may be valid in a handful of situations, but it does not hold in most medical and scientific applications where we initially may have only the vaguest understanding of what concepts can be learned. Based on this observation, we propose a never-ending learning framework for time series in which an agent examines an unbounded stream of data and occasionally asks a teacher (which may be a human or an algorithm) for a label. We demonstrate the utility of our ideas with experiments in domains as diverse as medicine, entomology, wildlife monitoring, and human behavior analyses.",KDD
Unlearn What You Have Learned: Adaptive Crowd Teaching with Exponentially Decayed Memory Learners,2018,"With the increasing demand for large amount of labeled data, crowdsourcing has been used in many large-scale data mining applications. However, most existing works in crowdsourcing mainly focus on label inference and incentive design. In this paper, we address a different problem of adaptive crowd teaching, which is a sub-area of machine teaching in the context of crowdsourcing. Compared with machines, human beings are extremely good at learning a specific target concept (e.g., classifying the images into given categories) and they can also easily transfer the learned concepts into similar learning tasks. Therefore, a more effective way of utilizing crowdsourcing is by supervising the crowd to label in the form of teaching. In order to perform the teaching and expertise estimation simultaneously, we propose an adaptive teaching framework named JEDI to construct the personalized optimal teaching set for the crowdsourcing workers. In JEDI teaching, the teacher assumes that each learner has an exponentially decayed memory. Furthermore, it ensures comprehensiveness in the learning process by carefully balancing teaching diversity and learner's accurate learning in terms of teaching usefulness. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and efficacy of JEDI teaching in comparison with the state-of-the-art techniques on multiple data sets with both synthetic learners and real crowdsourcing workers.",KDD
Parsing to Programs: A Framework for Situated QA,2018,"This paper introduces Parsing to Programs, a framework that combines ideas from parsing and probabilistic programming for situated question answering. As a case study, we build a system that solves pre-university level Newtonian physics questions. Our approach represents domain knowledge of Newtonian physics as programs. When presented with a novel question, the system learns a formal representation of the question by combining interpretations from the question text and any associated diagram. Finally, the system uses this formal representation to solve the questions using the domain knowledge. We collect a new dataset of Newtonian physics questions from a number of textbooks and use it to train our system. The system achieves near human performance on held-out textbook questions and section 1 of AP Physics C mechanics - both on practice questions as well as on freely available actual exams held in 1998 and 2012.",KDD
Semi-Supervised Techniques for Mining Learning Outcomes and Prerequisites,2017,"Educational content of today no longer only resides in textbooks and classrooms; more and more learning material is found in a free, accessible form on the Internet. Our long-standing vision is to transform this web of educational content into an adaptive, web-scale ""textbook"", that can guide its readers to most relevant ""pages"" according to their learning goal and current knowledge. In this paper, we address one core, long-standing problem towards this goal: identifying outcome and prerequisite concepts within a piece of educational content (e.g., a tutorial). Specifically, we propose a novel approach that leverages textbooks as a source of distant supervision, but learns a model that can generalize to arbitrary documents (such as those on the web). As such, our model can take advantage of any existing textbook, without requiring expert annotation. At the task of predicting outcome and prerequisite concepts, we demonstrate improvements over a number of baselines on six textbooks, especially in the regime of little to no ground-truth labels available. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of a model learned using our approach at the task of identifying prerequisite documents for adaptive content recommendation --- an important step towards our vision of the ""web as a textbook"".",KDD
Empowering authors to diagnose comprehension burden in textbooks,2012,Good textbooks are organized in a systematically progressive fashion so that students acquire new knowledge and learn new concepts based on known items of information. We provide a diagnostic tool for quantitatively assessing the comprehension burden that a textbook imposes on the reader due to non-sequential presentation of concepts. We present a formal definition of comprehension burden and propose an algorithmic approach for computing it. We apply the tool to a corpus of high school textbooks from India and empirically examine its effectiveness in helping authors identify sections of textbooks that can benefit from reorganizing the material presented.,KDD
Learning a Skill-Teaching Curriculum with Dynamic Bayes Nets,2011,We propose an intelligent tutoring system that constructs a curriculum of hints and problems in order to teach a student skills with a rich dependency structure. We provide a template for building a multi-layered Dynamic Bayes Net to model this problem and describe how to learn the parameters of the model from data. Planning with the DBN then produces a teaching policy for the given domain. We test this end-to-end curriculum design system in two human-subject studies in the areas of finite field arithmetic and artificial language and show this method performs on par with hand-tuned expert policies.,AAAI
Sketch Worksheets: A Sketch-Based Educational Software System,2010,"Intelligent tutoring systems and learning environments can provide important benefits for education, but few have been developed for heavily spatial domains. One bottleneck has been the lack of rich models of visual and conceptual processing in sketch understanding, so that what students draw can be interpreted in a human-like way. This paper describes Sketch Worksheets, a form of sketch-based educational software that mimics aspects of pencil and paper worksheets commonly found in classrooms, but provides on-the-spot feedback and support for richer off-line assessments. The basic architecture of sketch worksheets is described, including an authoring environment that allows non-developers to create them and a coach that uses analogy to compare student and instructor sketches as a means to provide feedback. A pilot experiment where sketch worksheets were used successfully in a college geoscience class in Fall 2009 is summarized to show the potential of the idea.",AAAI
A Semantics-based Model for Predicting Children's Vocabulary,2019,"Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) provide educational benefits through one-on-one tutoring by assessing children's existing knowledge and providing tailored educational content. In the domain of language acquisition, several studies have shown that children often learn new words by forming semantic relationships with words they already know. In this paper, we present a model that uses word semantics (semantics-based model) to make inferences about a child's vocabulary from partial information about their existing vocabulary knowledge. We show that the proposed semantics-based model outperforms models that do not use word semantics (semantics-free models) on average. A subject-level analysis of results reveals that different models perform well for different children, thus motivating the need to combine predictions. To this end, we use two methods to combine predictions from semantics-based and semantics-free models and show that these methods yield better predictions of a child's vocabulary knowledge. Our results motivate the use of semantics-based models to assess children's vocabulary knowledge and build ITS that maximizes children's semantic understanding of words.",IJCAI
Integrating Learner Help Requests Using a POMDP in an Adaptive Training System,2012,"This paper describes the development and empirical testing of an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) with two emerging methodologies: (1) a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) for representing the learner model and (2) inquiry modeling, which informs the learner model with questions learners ask during instruction. POMDPs have been successfully applied to non-ITS domains but, until recently, have seemed intractable for large-scale intelligent tutoring challenges. New, ITS-specific representations leverage common regularities in intelligent tutoring to make a POMDP practical as a learner model. Inquiry modeling is a novel paradigm for informing learner models by observing rich features of learnersÃ¢â¬â¢ help requests such as categorical content, context, and timing. The experiment described in this paper demonstrates that inquiry modeling and planning with POMDPs can yield significant and substantive learning improvements in a realistic, scenario-based training task.",AAAI
SKILL: A System for Skill Identification and Normalization,2015,"Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Named Entity Normalization (NEN) refer to the recognition and normalization of raw texts to known entities. From the perspective of recruitment innovation, professional skill characterization and normalization render human capital data more meaningful both commercially and socially. Accurate and detailed normalization of skills is the key for the predictive analysis of labor market dynamics. Such analytics help bridge the skills gap between employers and candidate workers by matching the right talent for the right job and identifying in-demand skills for workforce training programs. This can also work towards the social goal of providing more job opportunities to the community. In this paper we propose an automated approach for skill entity recognition and optimal normalization. The proposed system has two components: 1) Skills taxonomy generation, which employs vocational skill related sections of resumes and Wikipedia categories to define and develop a taxonomy of professional skills; 2) Skills tagging, which leverages properties of semantic word vectors to recognize and normalize relevant skills in input text. By sampling based end-user evaluation, the current system attains 91% accuracy on the taxonomy generation and 82% accuracy on the skills tagging tasks. The beta version of the system is currently applied in various big data and business intelligence applications for workforce analytics and career track projections at CareerBuilder.",AAAI
"Modeling Human Migration Patterns during Drought Conditions in La Guajira, Colombia",2018,"Modeling human mobility is key for a variety of applications such as migratory flows, epidemic modeling or traffic estimation. Recently, cell phone traces have been successfully used to model aggregated human mobility, in particular during natural disasters such as earthquakes or flooding. Climate-related environmental change brings a decline of productive agricultural land and livestock which will push rural residents to migrate. As a result, it also has the potential of causing changes in human mobility and cause migrations that have a wider and long standing impact. In this study, using anonymized and aggregated cell phone traces, we model the migrations that happened during a severe drought that happened in La Guajira, Colombia, in 2014. Our results indicate a linear reduction of the population of 10 percent during the 6 months considered for this study. Furthermore, predicting these migrations has about a 60% success rate for both the total number of people that migrate and to where they migrate. We also introduce a modification of the Radiation model in order to capture weather as one of the factors driving mobility, showing a RSS and RMSE reduction of 4.5% when compared with the standard models.",COMPASS
Predicting Links in Plant-Pollinator Interaction Networks Using Latent Factor Models with Implicit Feedback,2018,"Plant-pollinator interaction networks are bipartite networks representing the mutualistic interactions between a set of plant species and a set of pollinator species. Data on these networks are collected by field biologists, who count visits from pollinators to flowers. Ecologists study the structure and function of these networks for scientific, conservation, and agricultural purposes. However, little research has been done to understand the underlying mechanisms that determine pairwise interactions or to predict new links from networks describing the species community. This paper explores the use of latent factor models to predict interactions that will occur in new contexts (e.g. a different distribution of the set of plant species) based on an observed network. The analysis draws on algorithms and evaluation strategies developed for recommendation systems and introduces them to this new domain. The matrix factorization methods compare favorably against several baselines on a pollination dataset collected in montane meadows over several years. Incorporating both positive and negative implicit feedback into the matrix factorization methods is particularly promising.",AAAI
Anomaly Detection In The Presence Of Missing Values For Weather Data Quality Control,2019,"Accurate weather data is important for improving agricultural productivity in developing countries. Unfortunately, weather sensors can fail for a wide variety of reasons. One approach to detecting failed sensors is to identify statistical anomalies in the joint distribution of sensor readings. This powerful method can break down if some of the sensor readings are missing. This paper evaluates five strategies for handling missing values in anomaly detection: (a) mean imputation, (b) MAP imputation, (c) reduction (reduced-dimension anomaly detectors via feature bagging), (d) marginalization (for density estimators only), and (e) proportional distribution (for tree-based methods only). Our analysis suggests that MAP imputation and proportional distribution should give better results than mean imputation, reduction, and marginalization. These hypotheses are largely confirmed by experimental studies on synthetic data and on anomaly detection benchmark data sets using the Isolation Forest (IF), LODA, and EGMM anomaly detection algorithms. However, marginalization worked surprisingly well for EGMM, and there are exceptions where reduction works well on some benchmark problems. We recommend proportional distribution for IF, MAP imputation for LODA, and marginalization for EGMM.",COMPASS

A Fast Machine Learning Workflow for Rapid Phenotype Prediction from Whole Shotgun Metagenomes,2019,"Research on the microbiome is an emerging and crucial science that finds many applications in healthcare, food safety, precision agriculture and environmental studies. Huge amounts of DNA from microbial communities are being sequenced and analyzed by scientists interested in extracting meaningful biological information from this big data. Analyzing massive microbiome sequencing datasets, which embed the functions and interactions of thousands of different bacterial, fungal and viral species, is a significant computational challenge. Artificial intelligence has the potential for building predictive models that can provide insights for specific cutting edge applications such as guiding diagnostics and developing personalised treatments, as well as maintaining soil health and fertility. Current machine learning workflows that predict traits of host organisms from their commensal microbiome do not take into account the whole genetic material constituting the microbiome, instead basing the analysis on specific marker genes. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we introduce the first machine learning workflow that efficiently performs host phenotype prediction from whole shotgun metagenomes by computing similaritypreserving compact representations of the genetic material. Our workflow enables prediction tasks, such as classification and regression, from Terabytes of raw sequencing data that do not necessitate any pre-prossessing through expensive bioinformatics pipelines. We compare the performance in terms of time, accuracy and uncertainty of predictions for four different classifiers. More precisely, we demonstrate that our ML workflow can efficiently classify real data with high accuracy, using examples from dog and human metagenomic studies, representing a step forward towards real time diagnostics and a potential for cloud applications.",AAAI
Deep Sparse Coding based Recursive Disaggregation Model for Water Conservation,2013,"The increasing demands on drinkable water, along with population growth, water-intensive agriculture and economic development, pose critical challenges to water sustainability. New techniques to long-term water conservation that incorporate principles of sustainability are expected. Recent studies have shown that providing customers with usage information of fixtures could help them save a considerable amount of water. Existing disaggregation techniques focus on learning consumption patterns for individual devices. Little attention has been given to the hierarchical decomposition structure of the aggregated consumption. In this paper, a Deep Sparse Coding based Recursive Disaggregation Model (DSCRDM) is proposed for water conservation. We design a recursive decomposition structure to perform the disaggregation task, and introduce sequential set to capture its characteristics. An efficient and effective algorithm deep sparse coding is developed to automatically learn the disaggregation architecture, along with discriminative and reconstruction dictionaries for each layer. We demonstrated that our proposed approach significantly improved the performance of the benchmark methods on a large scale disaggregation task and illustrated how our model could provide practical feedbacks to customers for water conservation.",IJCAI
Modeling and Monitoring Crop Disease in Developing Countries,2011,"Information about the spread of crop disease is vital in developing countries, and as a result the governments of such countries devote scarce resources to gathering such data.

In this work we describe three general methods for improving the use of survey resources by performing data collection with mobile devices and by directing survey progress through the application of AI techniques. First, we describe a spatial disease density model based on Gaussian process ordinal regression, which offers a better representation of the disease level distribution, as compared to the statistical approaches typically applied. Second, we show how this model can be used to dynamically route survey teams to obtain the most valuable survey possible given a fixed budget. Third, we demonstrate that the diagnosis of plant disease can be automated using images taken by a camera phone, enabling data collection by survey workers with only basic training. We have applied our methods to the specific challenge of viral cassava disease monitoring in Uganda, for which we have implemented a real-time mobile survey system that will soon see practical use.",AAAI
Deep Gaussian Process for Crop Yield Prediction Based on Remote Sensing Data,2017,"Agricultural monitoring, especially in developing countries, can help prevent famine and support humanitarian efforts. A central challenge is yield estimation, i.e., predicting crop yields before harvest. We introduce a scalable, accurate, and inexpensive method to predict crop yields using publicly available remote sensing data. Our approach improves existing techniques in three ways. First, we forego hand-crafted features traditionally used in the remote sensing community and propose an approach based on modern representation learning ideas. We also introduce a novel dimensionality reduction technique that allows us to train a Convolutional Neural Network or Long-short Term Memory network and automatically learn useful features even when labeled training data are scarce. Finally, we incorporate a Gaussian Process component to explicitly model the spatio-temporal structure of the data and further improve accuracy. We evaluate our approach on county-level soybean yield prediction in the U.S. and show that it outperforms competing techniques.",AAAI
Deep Transfer Learning for Crop Yield Prediction with Remote Sensing Data (NOTE),2018,"Accurate prediction of crop yields in developing countries in advance of harvest time is central to preventing famine, improving food security, and sustainable development of agriculture. Existing techniques are expensive and difficult to scale as they require locally collected survey data. Approaches utilizing remotely sensed data, such as satellite imagery, potentially provide a cheap, equally effective alternative. Our work shows promising results in predicting soybean crop yields in Argentina using deep learning techniques. We also achieve satisfactory results with a transfer learning approach to predict Brazil soybean harvests with a smaller amount of data. The motivation for transfer learning is that the success of deep learning models is largely dependent on abundant ground truth training data. Successful crop yield prediction with deep learning in regions with little training data relies on the ability to fine-tune pre-trained models.",COMPASS
Accurate Estimates of Reference Evapotranspiration for Irrigation Management in the Texas High Plain,2013,"Accurate estimates of daily crop evapotranspiration (ET) are needed for efficient irrigation management in regions where crop water demand exceeds rainfall. Daily grass or alfalfa reference ET values and crop coefficients are widely used to estimate crop water demand. Inaccurate reference ET estimates can hence have a tremendous impact on irrigation costs and the demands on freshwater resources. ET networks calculate reference ET using precise measurements of meteorological data. These networks are typically characterized by gaps in spatial coverage and lack of sufficient funding, creating an immediate need for alternative sources that can fill data gaps without high costs. Although non-agricultural weather stations provide publicly accessible meteorological data, there are concerns that the data may be unsuitable for estimating reference ET due to factors such as weather station siting, data formats and quality control issues. The objective of our research is to enable the use of alternative data sources, adapting sophisticated machine learning algorithms such as Gaussian process models and neural networks to discover and model the nonlinear relationships between non-ET weather station data and the reference ET computed by ET networks. Using data from the Texas High Plains region in the U.S., we demonstrate significant improvement in estimation accuracy in comparison with baseline regression models typically used for irrigation management applications.",IJCAI
Crops Selection for Optimal Soil Planning using Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms,2008,"Farm managers have to deal with many conflicting objectives when planning which crop to cultivate. Soil characteristics are extremely important when determining yield potential. Fertilization and liming are commonly used to adapt soils to the nutritional requirements of the crops to be cultivated. Planting the crop that will best fit the soil characteristics is an interesting alternative to minimize the need for soil treatment, reducing costs and potential environmental damages. In addition, farmers usually look for investments that offer the greatest potential earnings with the least possible risks. According to the objectives to be considered the crop selection problem can be difficult to solve using traditional tools. Therefore, this work proposes an approach based on Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms to help in the selection of an appropriate cultivation plan considering five crop alternatives and five objectives simultaneously.",AAAI
Predicting Socio-Economic Indicators using News Events,2016,"Many socio-economic indicators are sensitive to real-world events. Proper characterization of the events can help to identify the relevant events that drive fluctuations in these indicators. In this paper, we propose a novel generative model of real-world events and employ it to extract events from a large corpus of news articles. We introduce the notion of an event class, which is an abstract grouping of similarly themed events. These event classes are manifested in news articles in the form of event triggers which are specific words that describe the actions or incidents reported in any article. We use the extracted events to predict fluctuations in different socio-economic indicators. Specifically, we focus on food prices and predict the price of 12 different crops based on real-world events that potentially influence food price volatility, such as transport strikes, festivals etc. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating event information in the prediction tasks reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) of prediction by 22% compared to the standard ARIMA model. We also predict sudden increases in the food prices (i.e. spikes) using events as features, and achieve an average 5-10% increase in accuracy compared to baseline models, including an LDA topic-model based predictive model.",KDD
Day-Ahead Hail Prediction Integrating Machine Learning with Storm-Scale Numerical Weather Models,2015,"Hail causes billions of dollars in losses by damaging buildings, vehicles, and crops. Improving the spatial and temporal accuracy of hail forecasts would allow people to mitigate hail damage. We have developed an approach to forecasting hail that identifies potential hail storms in storm-scale numerical weather prediction models and matches them with observed hailstorms. Machine learning models, including random forests, gradient boosting trees, and linear regression, are used to predict the expected hail size from each forecast storm. The individual hail size forecasts are merged with a spatial neighborhood ensemble probability technique to produce a consensus probability of hail at least 25.4 mm in diameter. The system was evaluated during the 2014 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Hazardous Weather Testbed Experimental Forecast Program and compared with a physics-based hail size model. The machine-learning-based technique shows advantages in producing smaller size errors and more reliable probability forecasts. The machine learning approaches correctly predicted the location and extent of a significant hail event in eastern Nebraska and a marginal severe hail event in Colorado.",AAAI
Quadratic optimization to identify highly heritable quantitative traits from complex phenotypic features,2013,"Identifying genetic variation underlying a complex disease is important. Many complex diseases have heterogeneous phenotypes and are products of a variety of genetic and environmental factors acting in concert. Deriving highly heritable quantitative traits of a complex disease can improve the identification of genetic risk of the disease. The most sophisticated methods so far perform unsupervised cluster analysis on phenotypic features; and then a quantitative trait is derived based on each resultant cluster. Heritability is estimated to assess the validity of the derived quantitative traits. However, none of these methods explicitly maximize the heritability of the derived traits. We propose a quadratic optimization approach that directly utilizes heritability as an objective during the derivation of quantitative traits of a disease. This method maximizes an objective function that is formulated by decomposing the traditional maximum likelihood method for estimating heritability of a quantitative trait. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on both synthetic data and real-world problems. We apply our algorithm to identify highly heritable traits of complex human-behavior disorders including opioid and cocaine use disorders, and highly heritable traits of dairy cattle that are economically important. Our approach outperforms standard cluster analysis and several previous methods.",KDD
Towards Sustainable Dairy Management - A Machine Learning Enhanced Method for Estrus Detection,2019,"Our research tackles the challenge of milk production resource use efficiency in dairy farms with machine learning methods. Reproduction is a key factor for dairy farm performance since cows milk production begin with the birth of a calf. Therefore, detecting estrus, the only period when the cow is susceptible to pregnancy, is crucial for farm efficiency. Our goal is to enhance estrus detection (performance, interpretability), especially on the currently undetected silent estrus (35% of total estrus), and allow farmers to rely on automatic estrus detection solutions based on affordable data (activity, temperature). In this paper, we first propose a novel approach with real-world data analysis to address both behavioral and silent estrus detection through machine learning methods. Second, we present LCE, a local cascade based algorithm that significantly outperforms a typical commercial solution for estrus detection, driven by its ability to detect silent estrus. Then, our study reveals the pivotal role of activity sensors deployment in estrus detection. Finally, we propose an approach relying on global and local (behavioral versus silent) algorithm interpretability (SHAP) to reduce the mistrust in estrus detection solutions.",KDD
State Space Models for Forecasting Water Quality Variables: An Application in Aquaculture Prawn Farming,2018,A novel approach to deterministic modelling of diurnal water quality parameters in aquaculture prawn ponds is presented. The purpose is to provide assistance to prawn pond farmers in monitoring pond water quality with limited data. Obtaining sufficient water quality data is generally a challenge in commercial prawn farming applications. Farmers can sustain large losses in their crop if water quality is not well managed. The model presented provides a means for modelling and forecasting various water quality parameters. It is inspired by data dynamics and does not rely on physical ecosystem modelling. The model is constructed within the Bayesian filtering framework. The Kalman filter and the unscented Kalman filer are applied for inference. The results demonstrate generalisability to both variables and environments. The ability for short term forecasting with mean absolute percentage errors between 0.5% and 11% is demonstrated.,KDD
A Tractable Leader-Follower MDP Model for Animal Disease Management,2013,"Sustainable animal disease management requires to design and implement control policies at the regional scale. However, for diseases which are not regulated, individual farmers are responsible for the adoption and successful application of control policies at the farm scale. Organizations (groups of farmers, health institutions...) may try to influence farmers' control actions through financial incentives, in order to ensure sustainable (from the health and economical point of views) disease management policies. Economics / Operations Research frameworks have been proposed for modeling the effect of incentives on agents. The Leader-Follower Markov Decision Processes framework is one such framework, that combines Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and stochastic games frameworks. However, since finding equilibrium policies in stochastic games is hard when the number of players is large, LF-MDP problems are intractable. Our contribution, in this article, is to propose a tractable model of the animal disease management problem. The tractable model is obtained through a few simple modeling approximations which are acceptable when the problem is viewed from the organization side. As a result, we design a polynomial-time algorithm for animal disease management, which we evaluate on a case study inspired from the problem of controlling the spread of the Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS).",AAAI
Price Forecasting & Anomaly Detection For Agricultural Commodities In India,2019,"Small and marginal farmers, who account for over 80% of India's agricultural population, often sell their harvest at low, unfavorable prices before spoilage. These farmers often lack access to either cold storage or market forecasts. In particular, by having access to cold storage, farmers can store their produce for longer and thus have more flexibility as to when they should sell their harvest by. Meanwhile, by having access to market forecasts, farmers can more easily identify which markets to sell at and when. While affordable cold storage solutions have become more widely available, there has been less work on produce price forecasting. A key challenge is that in many regions of India, predominantly in rural and remote areas, we have either very limited or no produce pricing data available from public online sources. In this paper, we present a produce price forecasting system that pulls data from the Indian Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare's website Agmarknet, trains a model of prices using over a thousand markets, and displays interpretable price forecasts in a web application viewable from a mobile phone. Due to the pricing data being extremely sparse, our method first imputes missing entries using collaborative filtering to obtain a dense dataset. Using this imputed dense dataset, we then train a decision-tree-based classifier to predict whether the price for a specific produce at a specific market will go up, stay the same, or go down. In terms of interpretability, we display the most relevant historical pricing data that drive each forecasted price trend, where we take advantage of the fact that a wide family of decision-tree-based ensemble learning methods are adaptive nearest neighbor methods. We also show how our approach generalizes to forecasting exact produce prices and constructing heuristic price uncertainty intervals. We validate forecast accuracy on data from Agmarknet and a small field survey of a few markets in Odisha.",COMPASS
Policy Gradient Planning for Environmental Decision Making with Existing Simulators,2011,"In environmental and natural resource planning domains actions are taken at a large number of locations over multiple time periods. These problems have enormous state and action spaces, spatial correlation between actions, uncertainty and complex utility models. We present an approach for modeling these planning problems as factored Markov decision processes. The reward model can contain local and global components as well as spatial constraints between locations. The transition dynamics can be provided by existing simulators developed by domain experts. We propose a landscape policy defined as the equilibrium distribution of a Markov chain built from many locally-parameterized policies. This policy is optimized using a policy gradient algorithm. Experiments using a forestry simulator demonstrate the algorithm's ability to devise policies for sustainable harvest planning of a forest.",AAAI
Reasoning about Connectivity Constraints,2015,"Many problems in computational sustainability involve constraints on connectivity. When designing a new wildlife corridor, we need it to be geographically connected. When planning the harvest of a forest, we need new areas to harvest to be connected to areas that have already been harvested so we can access them easily. And when town planning, we need to connect new homes to the existing utility infrastructure. To reason about connectivity, we propose a new family of global connectivity constraints. We identify when these constraints can be propagated tractably, and give some efficient, typically linear time propagators for when this is the case. We report results on several benchmark problems which demonstrate the efficiency of our propagation algorithms and the promise offered by reasoning globally about connectivity.",IJCAI
Maximum Sustainable Yield Problem for Robot Foraging and Construction System,2016,"We introduce the Maximum Sustainable Yield problem for a multi-robot foraging and construction system, inspired by the relationship between the natural resource growth and harvesting behaviors in an ecosystem. The resources spawn according to the logistic model and are vulnerable to overharvesting. The robots must maintain sustainability while maximizing productivity. The foraging robots harvest different types of resources, which enable a construction robot to build new foraging robots. We design algorithms to perform robot construction, assignment, and scheduling. We propose an adaptive algorithm to overcome the problem that resource growth model is often unknown. We demonstrate that our algorithms are robust to noises in the actuation and the environment. The case where the observation noise could harm sustainability is discussed.",IJCAI
Monitoring Entities in an Uncertain World: Entity Resolution and Referential Integrity,2011,"This paper describes a system to help intelligence analysts track and analyze information being published in multiple sources, particularly open sources on the Web. The system integrates technology for Web harvesting, natural language extraction, and network analytics, and allows analysts to view and explore the results via a Web application. One of the difficult problems we address is the entity resolution problem, which occurs when there are multiple, differing ways to refer to the same entity. The problem is particularly complex when noisy data is being aggregated over time, there is no clean master list of entities, and the entities under investigation are intentionally being deceptive. Our system must not only perform entity resolution with noisy data, but must also gracefully recover when entity resolution mistakes are subsequently corrected. We present a case study in arms trafficking that illustrates the issues, and describe how they are addressed.",AAAI
Automatic Annotation of Voice Forum Content for Rural Users and Evaluation of Relevance,2018,"Voice forums are an effective intervention medium for marginalized communities to access information in a structured and localized manner. Users actively contribute by posting questions and responses in the form of audio messages, and thereby help in enriching the voice forum content. In order to build an audio library using the voice forums to disseminate information, significant manual effort is needed in analyzing and curating the data. This is one of the key impediments to the successful implementation of voice forums for knowledge dissemination and training. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of automated approaches to analyze and curate voice forum content in Hindi, a native language in the northern part of India. We study the use of standard techniques such as topic modeling and extractive summarization on Hindi speech transcripts (with WER of 67%) to cluster audios thematically and create summaries for individual audios respectively. These curated audios are used to build an IVR-based library for community health workers in rural India. We evaluated the relevance and preference of the automated annotation using a field trail. We find that the relevance perception varied between human and automatically generated annotations, but automatically generated summaries were still found to be useful to access the voice forum audios.",COMPASS
Hetero-ConvLSTM: A Deep Learning Approach to Traffic Accident Prediction on Heterogeneous Spatio-Temporal Data,2018,"Predicting traffic accidents is a crucial problem to improving transportation and public safety as well as safe routing. The problem is also challenging due to the rareness of accidents in space and time and spatial heterogeneity of the environment (e.g., urban vs. rural). Most previous research on traffic accident prediction conducted by domain researchers simply applied classical prediction models on limited data without addressing the above challenges properly, thus leading to unsatisfactory performance. A small number of recent works have attempted to use deep learning for traffic accident prediction. However, they either ignore time information or use only data from a small and homogeneous study area (a city), without handling spatial heterogeneity and temporal auto-correlation properly at the same time. In this paper we perform a comprehensive study on the traffic accident prediction problem using the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) neural network model. A number of detailed features such as weather, environment, road condition, and traffic volume are extracted from big datasets over the state of Iowa across 8 years. To address the spatial heterogeneity challenge in the data, we propose a Hetero-ConvLSTM framework, where a few novel ideas are implemented on top of the basic ConvLSTM model, such as incorporating spatial graph features and spatial model ensemble. Extensive experiments on the 8-year data over the entire state of Iowa show that the proposed framework makes reasonably accurate predictions and significantly improves the prediction accuracy over baseline approaches.",KDD
DIY Model for Mobile Network Deployment: A Step Towards 5G for All (NOTE),2018,"Mobile phones and innovative data oriented mobile services have the potential to bridge the digital divide in Internet access and have transformative developmental impact. However as things stand currently, economics come in the way for traditional mobile operators to reach out and provide high-end services to under-served regions. We propose a do-it-yourself (DIY) model for deploying mobile networks in such regions that is in the spirit of earlier community cellular networks but aimed at provisioning high-end (4G and beyond) mobile services. Our proposed model captures and incorporates some of the key trends underlying 5G mobile networks and look to expand their scope beyond urban areas to reach all by empowering small-scale local operators and communities to build and operate modern mobile networks themselves. We showcase a particular instance of the proposed deployment model through a trial deployment in rural UK to demonstrate its practical feasibility.",COMPASS
An Assessment Of Sms Fraud In Pakistan,2019,"SMS fraud has become a growing concern for those working toward financial inclusion, however, it is often unclear how widespread such threats are in practice. This multi-method study investigates SMS fraud in Pakistan through identification and categorization of fraudulent messages as well as the impact on those who receive such messages. We collect fraudulent SMS messages by various means, including byway of a custom-built Android smartphone application. To complement this, we interview people exposed to SMS fraud and representatives of mobile network operators. Based on our analysis, lottery type fraud schemes dominate SMS fraud in Pakistan, and these schemes have the greatest impact on vulnerable low-income, rural populations. We offer a simple heuristic for fraud detection that has a high accuracy rate and is adaptable to evolving fraud schemes, and conclude with a recommendation for a fraud mitigation strategy to target fraudster call back numbers.",COMPASS
Examining The Use And Non-Use Of Mobile Payment Systems For Merchant Payments In India,2019,"Many countries across the globe are engaged in efforts to promotea cashless society. In India, there is a strong top-down push by thegovernment and the private sector for mobile payments.

Throughinterviews with 19 customers and 15 merchants across rural, peri-urban, and urban India, we explore peopleâs awareness about mobilepayment systems, perceived trade-offs among different paymentmethods, and the security, privacy, and utility barriers in its adop-tion and use. Overall, we found that customers were interested inadopting mobile payments for referral rewards and sign-up incen-tives, but were hesitant to regularly use them, whereas merchantssaw mobile payments as an unnecessary burden for their business.We discuss the nuanced views of customers and merchants, andoffer recommendations to address the barriers in the use of mobilepayments for customer-to-merchant transactions.",COMPASS
Male Partner Engagement in Family Planning SMS Conversations at Kenyan Health Clinics,2018,"Maternal health outreach and engagement is a common goal of mobile health (mHealth) projects for development. Male partners of pregnant and postpartum women are known to be important influences on their health behavior. This paper presents a novel extension to previous HCI4D research by exploring how to engage male partners in SMS-based family planning conversations. First, we explore design considerations for inclusion of male partners in an existing semi-automated bidirectional SMS platform. A 12-month randomized controlled trial of a family planning counseling SMS program was conducted in western Kenya using our system. A total of 260 pregnant women and 101 of their male partners were enrolled in the system. We analyze enrollment and usage data from this trial to compare baseline technology use and demographics of mothers and their male partners. Our findings demonstrate significant technology gender divides in the study population. Finally, we explore how both the mothers and their male partners interacted with the SMS system through an analysis of over 11,500 messages. We conclude that it is feasible to include rural Kenyan men in an SMS-based family planning discussion program and that their inclusion does not dramatically affect the mothers' engagement.",COMPASS
Improving the Quality of Point of Care Diagnostics with Real-Time Machine Learning in Low Literacy LMIC Settings,2018,"The scalability of medical technology in low resource settings requires a higher level of usability and clear decision support compared to conventional devices, since users often have very limited training. In particular, it is important to provide users with real time feedback on data quality during the patient information acquisition in a manner that enables the user to take immediate corrective action. In this work, we present an example of such a system, which provides real time feedback on the source of noise and interference on a low cost Doppler device connected to a smart-phone used by traditional birth attendants (TBAs) in rural Guatemala. A total of 195 fetal recordings made from 146 singleton pregnancies in the second and third trimester were recorded over 8 months by 19 TBAs. The resulting 33.7 hours of data were segmented into 0.75 s epochs and independently labeled by three trained researchers into one of five noise or quality categories that dominated the data. A two-step classifier, composed of a logistic regression and a multiclass support vector machine, was then trained to classify the data on epochs from 0.75 s to 3.75 s. After feature selection the highest micro-averaged test F1 score was 96.8% and macro-average F1 test score was 94.5% for 3.75 s segments using 23 features. A reduced real time model with 17 features produced comparable micro-and macro-averaged test F1 scores of 96.0% and 94.5% respectively. The code is portable back to a low-end smartphone to run on such a device in real time (under 400 ms) in order to provide an audiovisual cue for the TBAs via the smartphone. Future work will evaluate the classifier presented here as part of a decision support system for data quality improvement in an ongoing randomized control trial in Guatemala.",COMPASS
Adaptive Threshold Setting for Determining Spectrum Occupancy in TV White Space in Thailand (NOTE),2018,"This paper presents the results of spectrum occupancy measurements carried out in three different locations in Thailand: the Pathum Thani province (suburban), Bangkok (urban), and the Mae Kasa sub-district (rural) in the Tak province using a low-cost spectrum analyzer based system to show the spectrum occupancy at UHF TV band for testing the feasibility of TV White Space (TVWS) technology. Furthermore, inaccuracy of fixed threshold setting while performing spectrum occupancy measurements is shown by comparing the data with the ground truth report from the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC). An adaptive threshold setting algorithm, namely, Forward Consecutive Mean Excision (FCME) is then applied for determining the performance while carrying out spectrum occupancy measurements. Additionally, the adaptive threshold setting is modified to improve the accuracy of spectrum detection making the resultant spectrum occupancy more reliable.",COMPASS
Defamiliarizing the Domestic: Exploring âM-Kopa Solarâ Use and Sustainable Practices in Rural Kenyan Households,2018,"Domestic environments remain a topic of interest in HCI/Ubicomp, including how Information and Communication Technology (ICTs) can be designed to support sustainable practices in them. In this paper, we broaden the community's knowledge of these topics by studying them in rural Kenya. Specifically, we explore users' experiences with 'M-Kopa Solar', a commercially-available solar-powered lighting system for homes. We draw from our fieldwork, which primarily involved conducting interviews and observations at 21 households. In the process of learning about people's experiences with M-Kopa, we also learned about other sustainable practices that were central to their everyday lives. Our findings suggest that M-Kopa is a ""green"" solution to limited access to electricity in rural Kenya; in particular, we find that the system's design contributes to its success. These findings also raise questions about the long-term implications of such systems---especially in terms of how M-Kopa's marketing practices introduce people to consumption practices.

DeepUrbanMomentum: An Online Deep-Learning System for Short-Term Urban Mobility Prediction,2018,"Big human mobility data are being continuously generated through a variety of sources, some of which can be treated and used as streaming data for understanding and predicting urban dynamics. With such streaming mobility data, the online prediction of short-term human mobility at the city level can be of great significance for transportation scheduling, urban regulation, and emergency management. In particular, when big rare events or disasters happen, such as large earthquakes or severe traffic accidents, people change their behaviors from their routine activities. This means people's movements will almost be uncorrelated with their past movements. Therefore, in this study, we build an online system called DeepUrbanMomentum to conduct the next short-term mobility predictions by using (the limited steps of) currently observed human mobility data. A deep-learning architecture built with recurrent neural networks is designed to effectively model these highly complex sequential data for a huge urban area. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model as compared to the existing approaches. Lastly, we apply our system to a real emergency scenario and demonstrate that our system is applicable in the real world.",AAAI
DeepSTN+: Context-Aware Spatial-Temporal Neural Network for Crowd Flow Prediction in Metropolis,2019,"Crowd flow prediction is of great importance in a wide range of applications from urban planning, traffic control to public safety. It aims to predict the inflow (the traffic of crowds entering a region in a given time interval) and outflow (the traffic of crowds leaving a region for other places) of each region in the city with knowing the historical flow data. In this paper, we propose DeepSTN+, a deep learning-based convolutional model, to predict crowd flows in the metropolis. First, DeepSTN+ employs the ConvPlus structure to model the longrange spatial dependence among crowd flows in different regions. Further, PoI distributions and time factor are combined to express the effect of location attributes to introduce prior knowledge of the crowd movements. Finally, we propose an effective fusion mechanism to stabilize the training process, which further improves the performance. Extensive experimental results based on two real-life datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model, i.e., DeepSTN+ reduces the error of the crowd flow prediction by approximately 8%Ã¢ËÂ¼13% compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.",AAAI
Deep Spatio-Temporal Residual Networks for Citywide Crowd Flows Prediction,2017,"Forecasting the flow of crowds is of great importance to traffic management and public safety, and very challenging as it is affected by many complex factors, such as inter-region traffic, events, and weather. We propose a deep-learning-based approach, called ST-ResNet, to collectively forecast the inflow and outflow of crowds in each and every region of a city. We design an end-to-end structure of ST-ResNet based on unique properties of spatio-temporal data. More specifically, we employ the residual neural network framework to model the temporal closeness, period, and trend properties of crowd traffic. For each property, we design a branch of residual convolutional units, each of which models the spatial properties of crowd traffic. ST-ResNet learns to dynamically aggregate the output of the three residual neural networks based on data, assigning different weights to different branches and regions. The aggregation is further combined with external factors, such as weather and day of the week, to predict the final traffic of crowds in each and every region. Experiments on two types of crowd flows in Beijing and New York City (NYC) demonstrate that the proposed ST-ResNet outperforms six well-known methods.",AAAI
A case study: privacy preserving release of spatio-temporal density in paris,2014,"With billions of handsets in use worldwide, the quantity of mobility data is gigantic. When aggregated they can help understand complex processes, such as the spread viruses, and built better transportation systems, prevent traffic congestion. While the benefits provided by these datasets are indisputable, they unfortunately pose a considerable threat to location privacy.
 In this paper, we present a new anonymization scheme to release the spatio-temporal density of Paris, in France, i.e., the number of individuals in 989 different areas of the city released every hour over a whole week. The density is computed from a call-data-record (CDR) dataset, provided by the French Telecom operator Orange, containing the CDR of roughly 2 million users over one week. Our scheme is differential private, and hence, provides provable privacy guarantee to each individual in the dataset. Our main goal with this case study is to show that, even with large dimensional sensitive data, differential privacy can provide practical utility with meaningful privacy guarantee, if the anonymization scheme is carefully designed. This work is part of the national project XData (http://xdata.fr) that aims at combining large (anonymized) datasets provided by different service providers (telecom, electricity, water management, postal service, etc.).",KDD
Geo-spotting: mining online location-based services for optimal retail store placement,2013,"The problem of identifying the optimal location for a new retail store has been the focus of past research, especially in the field of land economy, due to its importance in the success of a business. Traditional approaches to the problem have factored in demographics, revenue and aggregated human flow statistics from nearby or remote areas. However, the acquisition of relevant data is usually expensive. With the growth of location-based social networks, fine grained data describing user mobility and popularity of places has recently become attainable.
 In this paper we study the predictive power of various machine learning features on the popularity of retail stores in the city through the use of a dataset collected from Foursquare in New York. The features we mine are based on two general signals: geographic, where features are formulated according to the types and density of nearby places, and user mobility, which includes transitions between venues or the incoming flow of mobile users from distant areas. Our evaluation suggests that the best performing features are common across the three different commercial chains considered in the analysis, although variations may exist too, as explained by heterogeneities in the way retail facilities attract users. We also show that performance improves significantly when combining multiple features in supervised learning algorithms, suggesting that the retail success of a business may depend on multiple factors.",KDD
Human Mobility Synchronization and Trip Purpose Detection with Mixture of Hawkes Processes,2017,"While exploring human mobility can benefit many applications such as smart transportation, city planning, and urban economics, there are two key questions that need to be answered: (i) What is the nature of the spatial diffusion of human mobility across regions with different urban functions? (ii) How to spot and trace the trip purposes of human mobility trajectories? To answer these questions, we study large-scale and city-wide taxi trajectories; and furtherly organize them as arrival sequences according to the chronological arrival time. We figure out an important property across different regions from the arrival sequences, namely human mobility synchronization effect, which can be exploited to explain the phenomenon that two regions have similar arrival patterns in particular time periods if they share similar urban functions. In addition, the arrival sequences are mixed by arrival events with distinct trip purposes, which can be revealed by the regional environment of both the origins and destinations. To that end, in this paper, we develop a joint model that integrates Mixture of Hawkes Process (MHP) with a hierarchical topic model to capture the arrival sequences with mixed trip purposes. Essentially, the human mobility synchronization effect is encoded as a synchronization rate in the MHP; while the regional environment is modeled by introducing latent Trip Purpose and POI Topic to generate the Point of Interests (POIs) in the regions. Moreover, we provide an effective inference algorithm for parameter learning. Finally, we conduct intensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world data, and the experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model.",KDD
A Machine Learning Approach to Modeling Human Migration,2018,"Human migration is a type of human mobility, where a trip involves a person moving with the intention of changing their home location. Predicting human migration as accurately as possible is important in city planning applications, international trade, spread of infectious diseases, conservation planning, and public policy development. Traditional human mobility models, such as gravity models or the more recent radiation model, predict human mobility flows based on population and distance features only. These models have been validated on commuting flows, a different type of human mobility, and are mainly used in modeling scenarios where large amounts of prior ground truth mobility data are not available. One downside of these models is that they have a fixed form and are therefore not able to capture more complicated migration dynamics. We propose machine learning models that are able to incorporate any number of exogenous features, to predict origin/destination human migration flows. Our machine learning models outperform traditional human mobility models on a variety of evaluation metrics, both in the task of predicting migrations between US counties as well as international migrations. In general, predictive machine learning models of human migration will provide a flexible base with which to model human migration under different what-if conditions, such as potential sea level rise or population growth scenarios.",COMPASS
DeepTransport: Prediction and Simulation of Human Mobility and Transportation Mode at a Citywide Level,2016,"Traffic congestion causes huge economic loss worldwide in every year due to wasted fuel, excessive air pollution, lost time, and reduced productivity. Understanding how humans move and select the transportation mode throughout a large-scale transportation network is vital for urban congestion prediction and transportation scheduling. In this study, we collect big and heterogeneous data (e.g., GPS records and transportation network data), and we build an intelligent system, namely DeepTransport, for simulating and predicting human mobility and transportation mode at a citywide level. The key component of DeepTransport is based on the deep learning architecture that that aims to understand human mobility and transportation patterns from big and heterogeneous data. Based on the learning model, given any time period, specific location of the city or people's observed movements, our system can automatically simulate or predict the persons' future movements and their transportation mode in the large-scale transportation network. Experimental results and validations demonstrate the efficiency and superior performance of our system, and suggest that human transportation mode may be predicted and simulated more easily than previously thought.",IJCAI
Exploring the Urban Region-of-Interest through the Analysis of Online Map Search Queries,2018,"Urban Region-of-Interest (ROI) refers to the integrated urban areas with specific functionalities that attract people's attentions and activities, such as the recreational business districts, transportation hubs, and city landmarks. Indeed, at the macro level, ROI is one of the representatives for agglomeration economies, and plays an important role in urban business planning. At the micro level, ROI provides a useful venue for understanding the urban lives, demands and mobilities of people. However, due to the vague and diversified nature of ROI, it still lacks of quantitative ways to investigate ROIs in a holistic manner. To this end, in this paper we propose a systematic study on ROI analysis through mining the large-scale online map query logs, which provides a new data-driven research paradigm for ROI detection and profiling. Specifically, we first divide the urban area into small region grids, and calculate their PageRank value as visiting popularity based on the transition information extracted from map queries. Then, we propose a density-based clustering method for merging neighboring region grids with high popularity into integrated ROIs. After that, to further explore the profiles of different ROIs, we develop a spatial-temporal latent factor model URPTM (Urban Roi Profiling Topic Model) to identify the latent travel patterns and Point-of-Interest (POI) demands of ROI visitors. Finally, we implement extensive experiments to empirically evaluate our approaches based on the large-scale real-world data collected from Beijing. Indeed, by visualizing the results obtained from URPTM, we can successfully obtain many meaningful travel patterns and interesting discoveries on urban lives.",KDD
CD-CNN: A Partially Supervised Cross-Domain Deep Learning Model for Urban Resident Recognition,2018,"Driven by the wave of urbanization in recent decades, the research topic about migrant behavior analysis draws great attention from both academia and the government. Nevertheless, subject to the cost of data collection and the lack of modeling methods, most of existing studies use only questionnaire surveys with sparse samples and non-individual level statistical data to achieve coarse-grained studies of migrant behaviors. In this paper, a partially supervised cross-domain deep learning model named CD-CNN is proposed for migrant/native recognition using mobile phone signaling data as behavioral features and questionnaire survey data as incomplete labels. Specifically, CD-CNN features in decomposing the mobile data into location domain and communication domain, and adopts a joint learning framework that combines two convolutional neural networks with a feature balancing scheme. Moreover, CD-CNN employs a three-step algorithm for training, in which the co-training step is of great value to partially supervised cross-domain learning. Comparative experiments on the city Wuxi demonstrate the high predictive power of CD-CNN. Two interesting applications further highlight the ability of CD-CNN for in-depth migrant behavioral analysis.",AAAI
The Automated Vacuum Waste Collection Optimization Problem,2012,"One of the most challenging problems on modern urban planning and one of the goals to be solved for smart city design is that of urban waste disposal. Given urban population growth, and that the amount of waste generated by each of us citizens is also growing, the total amount of waste to be collected and treated is growing dramatically (EPA 2011), becoming one sensitive issue for local governments. A modern technique for waste collection that is steadily being adopted is automated vacuum waste collection. This technology uses air suction on a closed network of underground pipes to move waste from the collection points to the processing station, reducing greenhouse gas emissions as well as inconveniences to citizens (odors, noise, . . . ) and allowing better waste reuse and recycling. This technique is open to optimize energy consumption because moving huge amounts of waste by air impulsion requires a lot of electric power. The described problem challenge here is, precisely, that of organizing and scheduling waste collection to minimize the amount of energy per ton of collected waste in such a system via the use of Artificial Intelligence techniques. This kind of problems are an inviting opportunity to showcase the possibilities that AI for Computational Sustainability offers.",AAAI
Contrastive Antichains in Hierarchies,2019,"Concepts are often described in terms of positive integer-valued attributes that are organized in a hierarchy. For example, cities can be described in terms of how many places there are of various types (e.g. nightlife spots, residences, food venues), and these places are organized in a hierarchy (e.g. a Portuguese restaurant is a type of food venue). This hierarchy imposes particular constraints on the values of related attributes---e.g. there cannot be more Portuguese restaurants than food venues. Moreover, knowing that a city has many food venues makes it less surprising that it also has many Portuguese restaurants, and vice versa. In the present paper, we attempt to characterize such concepts in terms of so-called contrastive antichains: particular kinds of subsets of their attributes and their values. We address the question of when a contrastive antichain is interesting, in the sense that it concisely describes the unique aspects of the concept, and this while duly taking into account the known attribute dependencies implied by the hierarchy. Our approach is capable of accounting for previously identified contrastive antichains, making iterative mining possible. Besides the interestingness measure, we also present an algorithm that scales well in practice, and demonstrate the usefulness of the method in an extensive empirical results section.",KDD
A Collective Bayesian Poisson Factorization Model for Cold-start Local Event Recommendation,2015,"Event-based social networks (EBSNs), in which organizers publish events to attract other users in local city to attend offline, emerge in recent years and grow rapidly. Due to the large volume of events in EBSNs, event recommendation is essential. A few recent works focus on this task, while almost all the methods need that each event to be recommended should have been registered by some users to attend. Thus they ignore two essential characteristics of events in EBSNs: (1) a large number of new events will be published every day which means many events have few participants in the beginning, (2) events have life cycles which means outdated events should not be recommended. Overall, event recommendation in EBSNs inevitably faces the cold-start problem.
 In this work, we address the new problem of cold-start local event recommendation in EBSNs. We propose a collective Bayesian Poisson factorization (CBPF) model for handling this problem. CBPF takes recently proposed Bayesian Poisson factorization as its basic unit to model user response to events, social relation, and content text separately. Then it further jointly connects these units by the idea of standard collective matrix factorization model. Moreover, in our model event textual content, organizer, and location information are utilized to learn representation of cold-start events for predicting user response to them. Besides, an efficient coordinate ascent algorithm is adopted to learn the model. We conducted comprehensive experiments on real datasets crawled from EBSNs and the results demonstrate our proposed model is effective and outperforms several alternative methods.",KDD
Mining Administrative Data to Spur Urban Revitalization,2015,"After decades of urban investment dominated by sprawl and outward growth, municipal governments in the United States are responsible for the upkeep of urban neighborhoods that have not received sufficient resources or maintenance in many years. One of city governments' biggest challenges is to revitalize decaying neighborhoods given only limited resources. In this paper, we apply data science techniques to administrative data to help the City of Memphis, Tennessee improve distressed neighborhoods. We develop new methods to efficiently identify homes in need of rehabilitation and to predict the impacts of potential investments on neighborhoods. Our analyses allow Memphis to design neighborhood-improvement strategies that generate greater impacts on communities. Since our work uses data that most US cities already collect, our models and methods are highly portable and inexpensive to implement. We also discuss the challenges we encountered while analyzing government data and deploying our tools, and highlight important steps to improve future data-driven efforts in urban policy.",KDD
Using Machine Learning To Help Vulnerable Tenants In New York City,2019,"To keep housing affordable, the City of New York has implemented rent-stabilization policies to restrict the rate at which the rent of certain units can be increased every year. However, some landlords of these rent-stabilized units try to illegally force their tenants out in order to circumvent rent-stabilization laws and greatly increase the rent they can charge. To identify and help tenants who are vulnerable to such landlord harassment, the New York City Public Engagement Unit (NYC PEU) conducts targeted outreach to tenants to inform them of their rights and to assist them with serious housing challenges. In this paper, we1 collaborated with NYC PEU to develop machine learning models to better prioritize outreach and help to vulnerable tenants. Our best-performing model can potentially help TSU find 59% more buildings where tenants face landlord harassment than the current outreach method using the same resources. The results also highlight the factors that help predict the risk of experiencing tenant harassment, and provide a data-driven and comprehensive approach to improve the city's policy of proactive outreach to vulnerable tenants.",COMPASS
UrbanFM: Inferring Fine-Grained Urban Flows,2019,"Urban flow monitoring systems play important roles in smart city efforts around the world. However, the ubiquitous deployment of monitoring devices, such as CCTVs, induces a long-lasting and enormous cost for maintenance and operation. This suggests the need for a technology that can reduce the number of deployed devices, while preventing the degeneration of data accuracy and granularity. In this paper, we aim to infer the real-time and fine-grained crowd flows throughout a city based on coarse-grained observations. This task is challenging due to the two essential reasons: the spatial correlations between coarse- and fine-grained urban flows, and the complexities of external impacts. To tackle these issues, we develop a method entitled UrbanFM based on deep neural networks. Our model consists of two major parts: 1) an inference network to generate fine-grained flow distributions from coarse-grained inputs by using a feature extraction module and a novel distributional upsampling module; 2) a general fusion subnet to further boost the performance by considering the influences of different external factors. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance on this problem.",KDD
Point-of-Interest Demand Modeling with Human Mobility Patterns,2017,"Point-of-Interest (POI) demand modeling in urban regions is critical for many applications such as business site selection and real estate investment. While some efforts have been made for the demand analysis of some specific POI categories, such as restaurants, it lacks systematic means to support POI demand modeling. To this end, in this paper, we develop a systematic POI demand modeling framework, named Region POI Demand Identification (RPDI), to model POI demands by exploiting the daily needs of people identified from their large-scale mobility data. Specifically, we first partition the urban space into spatially differentiated neighborhood regions formed by many small local communities. Then, the daily activity patterns of people traveling in the city will be extracted from human mobility data. Since the trip activities, even aggregated, are sparse and insufficient to directly identify the POI demands, especially for underdeveloped regions, we develop a latent factor model that integrates human mobility data, POI profiles, and demographic data to robustly model the POI demand of urban regions in a holistic way. In this model, POI preferences and supplies are used together with demographic features to estimate the POI demands simultaneously for all the urban regions interconnected in the city. Moreover, we also design efficient algorithms to optimize the latent model for large-scale data. Finally, experimental results on real-world data in New York City (NYC) show that our method is effective for identifying POI demands for different regions.",KDD
Towards mobility-based clustering,2010,"Identifying hot spots of moving vehicles in an urban area is essential to many smart city applications. The practical research on hot spots in smart city presents many unique features, such as highly mobile environments, supremely limited size of sample objects, and the non-uniform, biased samples. All these features have raised new challenges that make the traditional density-based clustering algorithms fail to capture the real clustering property of objects, making the results less meaningful. In this paper we propose a novel, non-density-based approach called mobility-based clustering. The key idea is that sample objects are employed as ""sensors"" to perceive the vehicle crowdedness in nearby areas using their instant mobility, rather than the ""object representatives"". As such the mobility of samples is naturally incorporated. Several key factors beyond the vehicle crowdedness have been identified and techniques to compensate these effects are proposed. We evaluate the performance of mobility-based clustering based on real traffic situations. Experimental results show that using 0.3% of vehicles as the samples, mobility-based clustering can accurately identify hot spots which can hardly be obtained by the latest representative algorithm UMicro.",KDD
WattHome: A Data-driven Approach for Energy Efficiency Analytics at City-scale,2018,"Buildings consume over 40% of the total energy in modern societies and improving their energy efficiency can significantly reduce our energy footprint. In this paper, we present WattHome, a data-driven approach to identify the least energy efficient buildings from a large population of buildings in a city or a region. Unlike previous approaches such as least squares that use point estimates, WattHome uses Bayesian inference to capture the stochasticity in the daily energy usage by estimating the parameter distribution of a building. Further, it compares them with similar homes in a given population using widely available datasets. WattHome also incorporates a fault detection algorithm to identify the underlying causes of energy inefficiency. We validate our approach using ground truth data from different geographical locations, which showcases its applicability in different settings. Moreover, we present results from a case study from a city containing >10,000 buildings and show that more than half of the buildings are inefficient in one way or another indicating a significant potential from energy improvement measures. Additionally, we provide probable cause of inefficiency and find that 41%, 23.73%, and 0.51% homes have poor building envelope, heating, and cooling system faults respectively.",KDD
A Data Science Approach to Understanding Residential Water Contamination in Flint,2017,"When the residents of Flint learned that lead had contaminated their water system, the local government made water-testing kits available to them free of charge. The city government published the results of these tests, creating a valuable dataset that is key to understanding the causes and extent of the lead contamination event in Flint. This is the nation's largest dataset on lead in a municipal water system.
 In this paper, we predict the lead contamination for each household's water supply, and we study several related aspects of Flint's water troubles, many of which generalize well beyond this one city. For example, we show that elevated lead risks can be (weakly) predicted from observable home attributes. Then we explore the factors associated with elevated lead. These risk assessments were developed in part via a crowd sourced prediction challenge at the University of Michigan. To inform Flint residents of these assessments, they have been incorporated into a web and mobile application funded by Google.org. We also explore questions of self-selection in the residential testing program, examining which factors are linked to when and how frequently residents voluntarily sample their water.",KDD
Transfer Knowledge between Cities,2016,"The rapid urbanization has motivated extensive research on urban computing. It is critical for urban computing tasks to unlock the power of the diversity of data modalities generated by different sources in urban spaces, such as vehicles and humans. However, we are more likely to encounter the label scarcity problem and the data insufficiency problem when solving an urban computing task in a city where services and infrastructures are not ready or just built. In this paper, we propose a FLexible multimOdal tRAnsfer Learning (FLORAL) method to transfer knowledge from a city where there exist sufficient multimodal data and labels, to this kind of cities to fully alleviate the two problems. FLORAL learns semantically related dictionaries for multiple modalities from a source domain, and simultaneously transfers the dictionaries and labelled instances from the source into a target domain. We evaluate the proposed method with a case study of air quality prediction.",KDD
Using Machine Learning to Assess the Risk of and Prevent Water Main Breaks,2018,"Water infrastructure in the United States is beginning to show its age, particularly through water main breaks. Main breaks cause major disruptions in everyday life for residents and businesses. Water main failures in Syracuse, N.Y. (as in most cities) are handled reactively rather than proactively. A barrier to proactive maintenance with limited resources is the city's inability to properly prioritize the allocation of its resources. We built a Machine Learning system to assess the risk of a water mains breaking. Using historical data on which mains have failed, descriptors of pipes, and other data sources, we evaluated several models' abilities to predict breaks three years into the future. Our results show that our system using gradient boosted decision trees performed best out of several algorithms and expert heuristics, achieving precision at 1% (P@1) of 0.62. Our model outperforms a random baseline (P@1 of 0.08) and expert heuristics such as water main age (P@1 of 0.10) and history of past main breaks (P@1 of 0.48). The model is currently deployed in the City of Syracuse. We are conducting a pilot by calculating the risk of failure for each city block over the period 2016-2018 using data up to the end of 2015 and, as of the end of 2017, there have been 42 breaks on our riskiest 52 mains. This has been a successful initiative for the city of Syracuse in improving its infrastructure and we believe this approach can be applied to other cities.",KDD
Analysis of advanced meter infrastructure data of water consumption in apartment buildings,2013,"We present our experience of using machine learning techniques over data originating from advanced meter infrastructure (AMI) systems for water consumption in a medium-size city. We focus on two new use cases that are of special importance to city authorities. One use case is the automatic identification of malfunctioning meters, with a focus on distinguishing them from legitimate non-consumption such as during periods when the household residents are on vacation. The other use case is the identification of leaks or theft in the unmetered common areas of apartment buildings. These two use cases are highly important to city authorities both because of the lost revenue they imply and because of the hassle to the residents in cases of delayed identification. Both cases are inherently complex to analyze and require advanced data mining techniques in order to achieve high levels of correct identification. Our results provide for faster and more accurate detection of malfunctioning meters as well as leaks in the common areas. This results in significant tangible value to the authorities in terms of increase in technician efficiency and a decrease in the amount of wasted, non-revenue, water.",KDD
Discovering regions of different functions in a city using human mobility and POIs,2012,"The development of a city gradually fosters different functional regions, such as educational areas and business districts. In this paper, we propose a framework (titled DRoF) that Discovers Regions of different Functions in a city using both human mobility among regions and points of interests (POIs) located in a region. Specifically, we segment a city into disjointed regions according to major roads, such as highways and urban express ways. We infer the functions of each region using a topic-based inference model, which regards a region as a document, a function as a topic, categories of POIs (e.g., restaurants and shopping malls) as metadata (like authors, affiliations, and key words), and human mobility patterns (when people reach/leave a region and where people come from and leave for) as words. As a result, a region is represented by a distribution of functions, and a function is featured by a distribution of mobility patterns. We further identify the intensity of each function in different locations. The results generated by our framework can benefit a variety of applications, including urban planning, location choosing for a business, and social recommendations. We evaluated our method using large-scale and real-world datasets, consisting of two POI datasets of Beijing (in 2010 and 2011) and two 3-month GPS trajectory datasets (representing human mobility) generated by over 12,000 taxicabs in Beijing in 2010 and 2011 respectively. The results justify the advantages of our approach over baseline methods solely using POIs or human mobility.",KDD
Towards Effective Prioritizing Water Pipe Replacement and Rehabilitation,2013,"Water pipe failures can not only have a great impact on people's daily life but also cause significant waste of water which is an essential and precious resource to human beings. As a result, preventative maintenance for water pipes, particularly in urban-scale networks, is of great importance for a sustainable society. To achieve effective replacement and rehabilitation, failure prediction aims to proactively find those 'most-likely-to-fail' pipes becomes vital and has been attracting more attention from both academia and industry, especially from the civil engineering field. This paper presents an already-deployed industrial computational system for pipe failure prediction. As an alternative to risk matrix methods often depending on ad-hoc domain heuristics, learning based methods are adopted using the attributes with respect to physical, environmental, operational conditions and etc. Further challenge arises in practice when lacking of profile attributes. A dive into the failure records shows that the failure event sequences typically exhibit temporal clustering patterns, which motivates us to use the stochastic process to tackle the failure prediction task. Specifically, the failure sequence is formulated as a self-exciting stochastic process which is, to our best knowledge, a novel formulation for pipe failure prediction. And we show that it outperforms a baseline assuming the failure risk grows linearly with aging. Broad new problems and research points for the machine learning community are also introduced for future work.",IJCAI
Dispatch Guided Allocation Optimization for Effective Emergency Response,2018,"Plant-pollinator interaction networks are bipartite networks representing the mutualistic interactions between a set of plant species and a set of pollinator species. Data on these networks are collected by field biologists, who count visits from pollinators to flowers. Ecologists study the structure and function of these networks for scientific, conservation, and agricultural purposes. However, little research has been done to understand the underlying mechanisms that determine pairwise interactions or to predict new links from networks describing the species community. This paper explores the use of latent factor models to predict interactions that will occur in new contexts (e.g. a different distribution of the set of plant species) based on an observed network. The analysis draws on algorithms and evaluation strategies developed for recommendation systems and introduces them to this new domain. The matrix factorization methods compare favorably against several baselines on a pollination dataset collected in montane meadows over several years. Incorporating both positive and negative implicit feedback into the matrix factorization methods is particularly promising.",AAAI
Migration as Submodular Optimization,2019,"Migration presents sweeping societal challenges that have recently attracted significant attention from the scientific community. One of the prominent approaches that have been suggested employs optimization and machine learning to match migrants to localities in a way that maximizes the expected number of migrants who find employment. However, it relies on a strong additivity assumption that, we argue, does not hold in practice, due to competition effects; we propose to enhance the data-driven approach by explicitly optimizing for these effects. Specifically, we cast our problem as the maximization of an approximately submodular function subject to matroid constraints, and prove that the worst-case guarantees given by the classic greedy algorithm extend to this setting. We then present three different models for competition effects, and show that they all give rise to submodular objectives. Finally, we demonstrate via simulations that our approach leads to significant gains across the board.",AAAI

Unsupervised P2P Rental Recommendations via Integer Programming,2017,"Due to the sparseness of quality rating data, unsupervised recommender systems are used in many applications in Peer to Peer (P2P) rental marketplaces such as Airbnb, FlipKey, and HomeAway. We present an integer programming based recommender systems, where both accommodation benefits and community risks of lodging places are measured and incorporated into an objective function as utility measurements. More specifically, we first present an unsupervised fused scoring method for quantifying the accommodation benefits and community risks of a lodging with crowd-sourced geo-tagged data. In order to the utility of recommendations, we formulate the unsupervised P2P rental recommendations as a constrained integer programming problem, where the accommodation benefits of recommendations are maximized and the community risks of recommendations are minimized, while maintaining constraints on personalization. Furthermore, we provide an efficient solution for the optimization problem by developing a learning-to-integer-programming method for combining aggregated listwise learning to rank into branching variable selection. We apply the proposed approach to the Airbnb data of New York City and provide lodging recommendations to travelers. In our empirical experiments, we demonstrate both the efficiency and effectiveness of our method in terms of striving a trade-off between the user satisfaction, time on market, and the number of reviews, and achieving a balance between positive and negative sides.",KDD
Using data mining techniques to address critical information exchange needs in disaster affected public-private networks,2010,"Crisis Management and Disaster Recovery have gained immense importance in the wake of recent man and nature inflicted calamities.

Discrete Relative States to Learn and Recognize Goals-Based Behaviors of Groups (Page 933),2013,"In a crisis management context, situation awareness is challenging due to the complexity of the environment and the limited resources available to the security forces. The different emerging threats are difficult to identify and the behavior of the crowd (separated in groups) is difficult to interpret and manage. In order to solve this problem, the authors propose a method to detect threat and understand the situation by analyzing the collective behavior of groups inside the crowd and detecting their goals. This is done according to a set of learned, goal-based, group behavior models and observation sequences of the group. The proposed method computes the group estimated state before using Hidden Markov Model to recognize the goal by the group behavior. A realistic emergency scenario is simulated to demonstrate the performance of the algorithms, where a suicide-bomber wearing a concealed bomb enters a busy urban street.

Modeling Human Behavior in the Aftermath of a Hypothetical Improvised Nuclear Detonation (Page 949),2013,"In this paper we describe a multiagent simulation model of human behavior in the aftermath of a hypothetical, large-scale, human-initiated crisis in the center of Washington D.C. Prior studies of this scenario have focused on modeling the physical effects of the attack, such as thermal and blast effects, prompt radiation, and fallout. Casualty and mortality estimates have been obtained by assuming a spatially static human population, ignoring human behavioral response to the event. We build a simulation of a behaving human population and its interaction with various interdependent infrastructures, to try to understand how human response to such an event would change outcomes, and also how modeling this response would enable us to develop new perspectives on planning for this event. Here we present details of the simulation, focusing on the agent design and multiagent interaction, and present initial results on how rapid restoration of communication could alter behavior beneficially.",AAMAS
Utilizing temporal patterns for estimating uncertainty in interpretable early decision making,2014,"Early classification of time series is prevalent in many time-sensitive applications such as, but not limited to, early warning of disease outcome and early warning of crisis in stock market. \textcolor{black}{ For example,} early diagnosis allows physicians to design appropriate therapeutic strategies at early stages of diseases. However, practical adaptation of early classification of time series requires an easy to understand explanation (interpretability) and a measure of confidence of the prediction results (uncertainty estimates). These two aspects were not jointly addressed in previous time series early classification studies, such that a difficult choice of selecting one of these aspects is required. In this study, we propose a simple and yet effective method to provide uncertainty estimates for an interpretable early classification method. The question we address here is ""how to provide estimates of uncertainty in regard to interpretable early prediction."" In our extensive evaluation on twenty time series datasets we showed that the proposed method has several advantages over the state-of-the-art method that provides reliability estimates in early classification. Namely, the proposed method is more effective than the state-of-the-art method, is simple to implement, and provides interpretable results.",KDD
Modeling Extreme Events in Time Series Prediction,2019,"Time series prediction is an intensively studied topic in data mining. In spite of the considerable improvements, recent deep learning-based methods overlook the existence of extreme events, which result in weak performance when applying them to real time series. Extreme events are rare and random, but do play a critical role in many real applications, such as the forecasting of financial crisis and natural disasters. In this paper, we explore the central theme of improving the ability of deep learning on modeling extreme events for time series prediction. Through the lens of formal analysis, we first find that the weakness of deep learning methods roots in the conventional form of quadratic loss. To address this issue, we take inspirations from the Extreme Value Theory, developing a new form of loss called Extreme Value Loss (EVL) for detecting the future occurrence of extreme events. Furthermore, we propose to employ Memory Network in order to memorize extreme events in historical records.By incorporating EVL with an adapted memory network module, we achieve an end-to-end framework for time series prediction with extreme events. Through extensive experiments on synthetic data and two real datasets of stock and climate, we empirically validate the effectiveness of our framework. Besides, we also provide a proper choice for hyper-parameters in our proposed framework by conducting several additional experiments.",KDD
Discovering shakers from evolving entities via cascading graph inference,2011,"In an interconnected and dynamic world, the evolution of one entity may cause a series of significant value changes for some others. For example, the currency inflation of Thailand caused the currency slump of other Asian countries, which eventually led to the financial crisis of 1997. We call such high impact entities shakers. To discover shakers, we first introduce the concept of a cascading graph to capture the causality relationships among evolving entities over some period of time, and then infer shakers from the graph. In a cascading graph, nodes represent entities and weighted links represent the causality effects. In order to find hidden shakers in such a graph, two scoring functions are proposed, each of which estimates how much the target entity can affect the values of some others. The idea is to artificially inject a significant change on the target entity, and estimate its direct and indirect influence on the others, by following an inference rule under the Markovian assumption. Both scoring functions are proven to be only dependent on the structure of a cascading graph and can be calculated in polynomial time. Experiments included three datasets in social sciences. Without directly applicable previous methods, we modified three graphical models as baselines. The two proposed scoring functions can effectively capture those high impact entities. For example, in the experiment to discover stock market shakers, the proposed models outperform the three baselines by as much as 50% in accuracy with the ground truth obtained from Yahoo!~Finance.",KDD

To address this lack, we propose novel `Periodic-CRN' (PCRN) method, which adapts convolutional recurrent network (CRN) to accurately capture spatial and temporal correlations, learns and incorporates explicit periodic representations, and can be optimized with multi-step ahead prediction. We show that PCRN consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for crowd density prediction across two taxi datasets from Beijing and Singapore.",IJCAI
Benders Decomposition for Large-Scale Prescriptive Evacuations,2016,"This paper considers prescriptive evacuation planning for a region threatened by a natural disaster such a flood, a wildfire, or a hurricane. It proposes a Benders decomposition that generalizes the two-stage approach proposed in earlier work for convergent evacuation plans. Experimental results show that Benders decomposition provides significant improvements in solution quality in reasonable time: It finds provably optimal solutions to scenarios considered in prior work, closing these instances, and increases the number of evacuees by 10 to 15% on average on more complex flood scenarios.",AAAI
Transfer Learning from Deep Features for Remote Sensing and Poverty Mapping,2016,"The lack of reliable data in developing countries is a major obstacle to sustainable development, food security, and disaster relief. Poverty data, for example, is typically scarce, sparse in coverage, and labor-intensive to obtain. Remote sensing data such as high-resolution satellite imagery, on the other hand, is becoming increasingly available and inexpensive. Unfortunately, such data is highly unstructured and currently no techniques exist to automatically extract useful insights to inform policy decisions and help direct humanitarian efforts. We propose a novel machine learning approach to extract large-scale socioeconomic indicators from high-resolution satellite imagery. The main challenge is that training data is very scarce, making it difficult to apply modern techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We therefore propose a transfer learning approach where nighttime light intensities are used as a data-rich proxy. We train a fully convolutional CNN model to predict nighttime lights from daytime imagery, simultaneously learning features that are useful for poverty prediction. The model learns filters identifying different terrains and man-made structures, including roads, buildings, and farmlands, without any supervision beyond nighttime lights. We demonstrate that these learned features are highly informative for poverty mapping, even approaching the predictive performance of survey data collected in the field.",AAAI
Predisaster Preparation of Transportation Networks,2015,"We develop a new approach for a pre-disaster planning problem which consists in computing an optimal investment plan to strengthen a transportation network, given that a future disaster probabilistically destroys links in the network. We show how the problem can be formulated as a non-linear integer program and devise an AI algorithm to solve it. In particular, we introduce a new type of extreme resource constraint and develop a practically efficient propagation algorithm for it. Experiments show several orders of magnitude improvements over existing approaches, allowing us to close an existing real-world benchmark and to solve to optimality other, more challenging benchmarks.",AAAI
"Profiles, Proxies, and Assumptions: Decentralized, Communications-Resilient Planning, Allocation, and Scheduling",2019,"Degraded communications are expected in large-scale disaster response and military operations, which nevertheless require rapid, concerted actions by distributed decision makers, each with limited visibility into the changing situation and in charge of a limited set of resources. We describe LAPLATA, a novel architecture that addresses these challenges by separating mission planning from allocation/scheduling for scalability but at the cost of some negotiation. We describe formal algorithms that achieve near-optimal performance according to mission completion percentage and subject matter expert review: assumption-based planning and replanning, profileassisted cooperative allocation, and schedule negotiation. We validate our approach on a realistic problem specification and compare results against subject matter expert solutions.",AAAI
Shortest Path Based Decision Making Using Probabilistic Inference,2016,"We present a new perspective on the classical shortest path routing (SPR) problem in graphs. We show that the SPR problem can be recast to that of probabilistic inference in a mixture of simple Bayesian networks. Maximizing the likelihood in this mixture becomes equivalent to solving the SPR problem. We develop the well known Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for the SPR problem that maximizes the likelihood, and show that it does not get stuck in a locally optimal solution. Using the same probabilistic framework, we then address an NP-Hard network design problem where the goal is to repair a network of roads post some disaster within a fixed budget such that the connectivity between a set of nodes is optimized. We show that our likelihood maximization approach using the EM algorithm scales well for this problem taking the form of message-passing among nodes of the graph, and provides significantly better quality solutions than a standard mixed-integer programming solver.",AAAI
"Multi3Net: Segmenting Flooded Buildings via Fusion of Multiresolution, Multisensor, and Multitemporal Satellite Imagery",2019,"We propose a novel approach for rapid segmentation of flooded buildings by fusing multiresolution, multisensor, and multitemporal satellite imagery in a convolutional neural network. Our model significantly expedites the generation of satellite imagery-based flood maps, crucial for first responders and local authorities in the early stages of flood events. By incorporating multitemporal satellite imagery, our model allows for rapid and accurate post-disaster damage assessment and can be used by governments to better coordinate medium- and long-term financial assistance programs for affected areas. The network consists of multiple streams of encoder-decoder architectures that extract spatiotemporal information from medium-resolution images and spatial information from high-resolution images before fusing the resulting representations into a single medium-resolution segmentation map of flooded buildings. We compare our model to state-of-the-art methods for building footprint segmentation as well as to alternative fusion approaches for the segmentation of flooded buildings and find that our model performs best on both tasks. We also demonstrate that our model produces highly accurate segmentation maps of flooded buildings using only publicly available medium-resolution data instead of significantly more detailed but sparsely available very high-resolution data. We release the first open-source dataset of fully preprocessed and labeled multiresolution, multispectral, and multitemporal satellite images of disaster sites along with our source code.",AAAI
Coordinating Human-UAV Teams in Disaster Response,2016,"We consider a disaster response scenario where emergency responders have to complete rescue tasks in dynamic and uncertain environment with the assistance of multiple UAVs to collect information about the disaster space. To capture the uncertainty and partial observability of the domain, we model this problem as a POMDP. However, the resulting model is computationally intractable and cannot be solved by most existing POMDP solvers due to the large state and action spaces. By exploiting the problem structure we propose a novel online planning algorithm to solve this model. Specifically, we generate plans for the responders based on Monte-Carlo simulations and compute actions for the UAVs according to the value of information. Our empirical results confirm that our algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art both in time and solution quality.",IJCAI
HAC-ER: A Disaster Response System Based on Human-Agent Collectives (Page 533),2015,"This paper proposes a novel disaster management system called HAC-ER that addresses some of the challenges faced by emergency responders by enabling humans and agents, using state-of-the-art algorithms, to collaboratively plan and carry out tasks in teams referred to as human-agent collectives. In particular, HAC-ER utilises crowdsourcing combined with machine learning to extract situational awareness information from large streams of reports posted by members of the public and trusted organisations. We then show how this information can inform human-agent teams in coordinating multi-UAV deployments as well as task planning for responders on the ground. Finally, HAC-ER incorporates a tool for tracking and analysing the provenance of information shared across the entire system. In summary, this paper describes a prototype system, validated by real-world emergency responders, that combines several state-of-the-art techniques for integrating humans and agents, and illustrates, for the first time, how such an approach can enable more effective disaster response operations.

Predicting Evacuation Decisions using Representations of Individuals' Pre-Disaster Web Search Behavior,2019,"Predicting the evacuation decisions of individuals before the disaster strikes is crucial for planning first response strategies. In addition to the studies on post-disaster analysis of evacuation behavior, there are various works that attempt to predict the evacuation decisions beforehand. Most of these predictive methods, however, require real time location data for calibration, which are becoming much harder to obtain due to the rising privacy concerns. Meanwhile, web search queries of anonymous users have been collected by web companies. Although such data raise less privacy concerns, they have been under-utilized for various applications. In this study, we investigate whether web search data observed prior to the disaster can be used to predict the evacuation decisions. More specifically, we utilize a session-based query encoder that learns the representations of each user's web search behavior prior to evacuation. Our proposed approach is empirically tested using web search data collected from users affected by a major flood in Japan. Results are validated using location data collected from mobile phones of the same set of users as ground truth. We show that evacuation decisions can be accurately predicted (84%) using only the users' pre-disaster web search data as input. This study proposes an alternative method for evacuation prediction that does not require highly sensitive location data, which can assist local governments to prepare effective first response strategies.",KDD
A Methodology for Deploying the Max-Sum Algorithm and a Case Study on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,2012,"We present a methodology for the deployment of the max-sum algorithm, a well known decentralised algorithm for coordinating autonomous agents, for problems related to situational awareness. In these settings, unmanned autonomous vehicles are deployed to collect information about an unknown environment. Our methodology then helps identify the choices that need to be made to apply the algorithm to these problems. Next, we present a case study where the methodology is used to develop a system for disaster management in which a team of unmanned aerial vehicles coordinate to provide the first responders of the area of a disaster with live aerial imagery. To evaluate this system, we deploy it on two unmanned hexacopters in a variety of scenarios. Our tests show that the system performs well when confronted with the dynamism and the heterogeneity of the real world.",AAAI
Modeling and probabilistic reasoning of population evacuation during large-scale disaster,2013,"The Great East Japan Earthquake and the Fukushima nuclear accident cause large human population movements and evacuations. Understanding and predicting these movements is critical for planning effective humanitarian relief, disaster management, and long-term societal reconstruction. In this paper, we construct a large human mobility database that stores and manages GPS records from mobile devices used by approximately 1.6 million people throughout Japan from 1 August 2010 to 31 July 2011. By mining this enormous set of Auto-GPS mobile sensor data, the short-term and long-term evacuation behaviors for individuals throughout Japan during this disaster are able to be automatically discovered. To better understand and simulate human mobility during the disasters, we develop a probabilistic model that is able to be effectively trained by the discovered evacuations via machine learning technique. Based on our training model, population mobility in various cities impacted by the disasters throughout the country is able to be automatically simulated or predicted. On the basis of the whole database, developed model, and experimental results, it is easy for us to find some new features or population mobility patterns after the recent severe earthquake, tsunami and release of radioactivity in Japan, which are likely to play a vital role in future disaster relief and management worldwide.",KDD
An Efficient Simulation-Based Approach to Ambulance Fleet Allocation and Dynamic Redeployment,2012,"We present an efficient approach to ambulance fleet allocation and dynamic redeployment, where the goal is to position an entire fleet of ambulances to base locations to maximize the service level (or utility) of the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) system. We take a simulation-based approach, where the utility of an allocation is measured by directly simulating emergency requests. In both the static and dynamic settings, this modeling approach leads to an exponentially large action space (with respect to the number of ambulances). Futhermore, the utility of any particular allocation can only be measured via a seemingly Ã¢â¬Åblack boxÃ¢â¬Â simulator. Despite this complexity, we show that embedding our simulator within a simple and efficient greedy allocation algorithm produces good solutions. We derive data-driven performance guarantees which yield small optimality gap. Given its efficiency, we can repeatedly employ this approach in real-time for dynamic repositioning. We conduct simulation experiments based on real usage data of an EMS system from a large Asian city, and demonstrate significant improvement in the systemÃ¢â¬â¢s service levels using static allocations and redeployment policies discovered by our approach.",AAAI
Tornado Forecasting with Multiple Markov Boundaries,2015,"Reliable tornado forecasting with a long-lead time can greatly support emergency response and is of vital importance for the economy and society. The large number of meteorological variables in spatiotemporal domains and the complex relationships among variables remain the top difficulties for a long-lead tornado forecasting.
 Standard data mining approaches to tackle high dimensionality are usually designed to discover a single set of features without alternating options for domain scientists to select more reliable and physical interpretable variables.
 In this work, we provide a new solution to use the concept of multiple Markov boundaries in local causal discovery to identify multiple sets of the precursors for tornado forecasting. Specifically, our algorithm first confines the extremely large feature spaces to a small core feature space, then it mines multiple sets of the precursors from the core feature space that may equally contribute to tornado forecasting. With the multiple sets of the precursors, we are able to report to domain scientists the predictive but practical set of precursors.
 An extensive empirical study is conducted on eight benchmark data sets and the historical tornado data near Oklahoma City, OK in the United States. Experimental results show that the tornado precursors we identified can help to improve the reliability of long-lead time catastrophic tornado forecasting.",KDD
Optimizing Infrastructure Enhancements for Evacuation Planning,2016,"With rapid population growth and urbanization, emergency services in various cities around the world worry that the current transportation infrastructure is no longer adequate for large-scale evacuations. This paper considers how to mitigate this issue through infrastructure upgrades, such as the additions of lanes to road segments and the raising of bridges and roads. The paper proposes a MIP model for deciding the most effective infrastructure upgrades as well as a Benders decomposition approach where the master problem jointly plans the upgrades and evacuation routes and the subproblem schedules the evacuation itself. Experimental results demonstrate the practicability of the approach on a real case study, filling a significant need for emergencies services.",AAAI
Optimizing Resilience in Large Scale Networks,2016,"We propose a decision making framework to optimize the resilience of road networks to natural disasters such as floods. Our model generalizes an existing one for this problem by allowing roads with a broad class of stochastic delay models. We then present a fast algorithm based on the sample average approximation (SAA) method and network design techniques to solve this problem approximately. On a small existing benchmark, our algorithm produces near-optimal solutions and the SAA method converges quickly with a small number of samples. We then apply our algorithm to a large real-world problem to optimize the resilience of a road network to failures of stream crossing structures to minimize travel times of emergency medical service vehicles. On medium-sized networks, our algorithm obtains solutions of comparable quality to a greedy baseline method but is 30Ã¢â¬â60 times faster. Our algorithm is the only existing algorithm that can scale to the full network, which has many thousands of edges.",AAAI
Predicting Ambulance Demand: a Spatio-Temporal Kernel Approach,2015,"Predicting ambulance demand accurately at fine time and location scales is critical for ambulance fleet management and dynamic deployment. Large-scale datasets in this setting typically exhibit complex spatio-temporal dynamics and sparsity at high resolutions. We propose a predictive method using spatio-temporal kernel density estimation (stKDE) to address these challenges, and provide spatial density predictions for ambulance demand in Toronto, Canada as it varies over hourly intervals. Specifically, we weight the spatial kernel of each historical observation by its informativeness to the current predictive task. We construct spatio-temporal weight functions to incorporate various temporal and spatial patterns in ambulance demand, including location-specific seasonalities and short-term serial dependence. This allows us to draw out the most helpful historical data, and exploit spatio-temporal patterns in the data for accurate and fast predictions. We further provide efficient estimation and customizable prediction procedures. stKDE is easy to use and interpret by non-specialized personnel from the emergency medical service industry. It also has significantly higher statistical accuracy than the current industry practice, with a comparable amount of computational expense.",KDD
Bangladesh Emergency Services: A Mobile Application to Provide 911-Like Service in Bangladesh,2018,"We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of Bangladesh Emergency Services (BES), a mobile application that provides 911-like services in Bangladesh. The involvement of A2I, a government agency, helped in the nationwide deployment of BES. To date, 120,382 unique users downloaded BES and 27,117 users are actively using it. Analysis of user ratings (N=3,788) and reviews (N=1,231) from Google Play Store, an online survey (N=137), and face-to-face interviews (N=10) revealed that users considered BES effective. Currently, BES is used to report aggressive behavior, street fight, harassment, fire-related incidents, and for locating nearby hospitals for medical emergencies. Our findings highlight the importance of trustworthiness, scalability of service, and iterative and participatory design for successful deployment of such services. We believe our research will inspire the design of mobile-based emergency applications in other developing countries that lack 911-like services.",COMPASS
Improving Law Enforcement Daily Deployment Through Machine Learning-Informed Optimization under Uncertainty,2019,"Urban law enforcement agencies are under great pressure to respond to emergency incidents effectively while operating within restricted budgets. Minutes saved on emergency response times can save lives and catch criminals, and a responsive police force can deter crime and bring peace of mind to citizens. To efficiently minimize the response times of a law enforcement agency operating in a dense urban environment with limited manpower, we consider in this paper the problem of optimizing the spatial and temporal deployment of law enforcement agents to predefined patrol regions in a real-world scenario informed by machine learning. To this end, we develop a mixed integer linear optimization formulation (MIP) to minimize the risk of failing response time targets. Given the stochasticity of the environment in terms of incident numbers, location, timing, and duration, we use Sample Average Approximation (SAA) to find a robust deployment plan. To overcome the sparsity of real data, samples are provided by an incident generator that learns the spatio-temporal distribution and demand parameters of incidents from a real world historical dataset and generates sets of training incidents accordingly. To improve runtime performance across multiple samples, we implement a heuristic based on Iterated Local Search (ILS), as the solution is intended to create deployment plans quickly on a daily basis. Experimental results demonstrate that ILS performs well against the integer model while offering substantial gains in execution time.",IJCAI
Intelligent System for Urban Emergency Management during Large-Scale Disaster,2014,"The frequency and intensity of natural disasters has significantly increased over the past decades and this trend is predicted to continue.

The proposed systemstores and manages the global positioning system (GPS) records from mobile devices used by approximately 1.6 million people throughout Japan over one year. By mining and analyzing population movements after the Great East Japan Earthquake, our system can automatically learn a probabilistic model to better understand and simulate human mobility during the emergency situations. Based on the learning model, population mobility in various urban areas impacted by the earthquake throughout Japan can be automatically simulated or predicted. On the basis of such kind of system, it is easy for us to find some new features or population mobility patterns after the recent and unprecedented composite disasters, which are likely to provide valuable experience and play a vital role for future disaster management worldwide.",AAAI
A Simulator of Human Emergency Mobility Following Disasters: Knowledge Transfer from Big Disaster Data,2015,"The frequency and intensity of natural disasters has significantly increased over the past decades and this trend is predicted to continue. Facing these possible and unexpected disasters, understanding and simulating of human emergency mobility following disasters will becomethe critical issue for planning effective humanitarian relief, disaster management, and long-term societal reconstruction. However, due to the uniquenessof various disasters and the unavailability of reliable and large scale human mobility data, such kind of research is very difficult to be performed. Hence, in this paper,we collect big and heterogeneous data (e.g. 1.6 million users' GPS records in three years, 17520 times of Japan earthquake data in four years, news reporting data, transportation network data and etc.) to capture and analyze human emergency mobility following different disasters. By mining these big data, we aim to understand what basic laws govern human mobility following disasters, and develop a general model of human emergency mobility for generating and simulating large amount of human emergency movements. The experimental results and validations demonstrate the efficiency of our simulation model, and suggest that human mobility following disasters may be significantly morepredictable and can be easier simulated than previously thought.",AAAI
Prediction of human emergency behavior and their mobility following large-scale disaster,2014,"The frequency and intensity of natural disasters has significantly increased over the past decades and this trend is predicted to continue. Facing these possible and unexpected disasters, accurately predicting human emergency behavior and their mobility will become the critical issue for planning effective humanitarian relief, disaster management, and long-term societal reconstruction. In this paper, we build up a large human mobility database (GPS records of 1.6 million users over one year) and several different datasets to capture and analyze human emergency behavior and their mobility following the Great East Japan Earthquake and Fukushima nuclear accident. Based on our empirical analysis through these data, we find that human behavior and their mobility following large-scale disaster sometimes correlate with their mobility patterns during normal times, and are also highly impacted by their social relationship, intensity of disaster, damage level, government appointed shelters, news reporting, large population flow and etc. On the basis of these findings, we develop a model of human behavior that takes into account these factors for accurately predicting human emergency behavior and their mobility following large-scale disaster.

Accessible Privacy-Preserving Web-Based Data Analysis for Assessing and Addressing Economic Inequalities (NOTE),2018,"An essential component of initiatives that aim to address pervasive inequalities of any kind is the ability to collect empirical evidence of both the status quo baseline and of any improvement that can be attributed to prescribed and deployed interventions. Unfortunately, two substantial barriers can arise preventing the collection and analysis of such empirical evidence: (1) the sensitive nature of the data itself and (2) a lack of technical sophistication and infrastructure available to both an initiative's beneficiaries and to those spearheading it. In the last few years, it has been shown that a cryptographic primitive called secure multi-party computation (MPC) can provide a natural technological resolution to this conundrum. MPC allows an otherwise disinterested third party to contribute its technical expertise and resources, to avoid incurring any additional liabilities itself, and (counterintuitively) to reduce the level of data exposure that existing parties must accept to achieve their data analysis goals. However, achieving these benefits requires the deliberate design of MPC tools and frameworks whose level of accessibility to non-technical users with limited infrastructure and expertise is state-of-the-art. We describe our own experiences designing, implementing, and deploying such usable web applications for secure data analysis within the context of two real-world initiatives that focus on promoting economic equality.",COMPASS
Designing Policy Recommendations to Reduce Home Abandonment in Mexico,2016,"Infonavit, the largest provider of mortgages in Mexico, assists working families to obtain low-interest rate housing solutions. An increasingly prevalent problem is home abandonment: when a homeowner decides to leave their property and forego their investment. A major causal factor of this outcome is a mismatch between the homeowner's needs, in terms of access to services and employment, and the location characteristics of the home. This paper describes our collaboration with Infonavit to reduce home abandonment at two levels: develop policy recommendations for targeted improvements in location characteristics, and develop a decision-support tool to assist the homeowner in the home location decision. Using 20 years of mortgage history data combined with surveys, census, and location information, we develop a model to predict the probability of home abandonment based on both individual and location characteristics. The model is used to develop a tool that provides Infonavit the ability to give advice to Mexican workers when they apply for a loan, evaluate and improve the locations of new housing developments, and provide data-driven recommendations to the federal government to influence local development initiatives and infrastructure investments. The result is improving economic outcomes for the citizens of Mexico by pre-emptively identifying at-risk home mortgages, thereby allowing them to be altered or remedied before they result in abandonment.",KDD
Allocating Interventions Based on Predicted Outcomes: A Case Study on Homelessness Services,2019,"Modern statistical and machine learning methods are increasingly capable of modeling individual or personalized treatment effects. These predictions could be used to allocate different interventions across populations based on individual characteristics. In many domains, like social services, the availability of different possible interventions can be severely resource limited. This paper considers possible improvements to the allocation of such services in the context of homelessness service provision in a major metropolitan area. Using data from the homeless system, we use a counterfactual approach to show potential for substantial benefits in terms of reducing the number of families who experience repeat episodes of homelessness by choosing optimal allocations (based on predicted outcomes) to a fixed number of beds in different types of homelessness service facilities. Such changes in the allocation mechanism would not be without tradeoffs, however; a significant fraction of households are predicted to have a higher probability of re-entry in the optimal allocation than in the original one. We discuss the efficiency, equity and fairness issues that arise and consider potential implications for policy.",AAAI

Drawing on survey data with 508 participants, we found thattrust in institutions, computer self-efficacy, and perceived ease ofuse positively correlate to individualsâ past use of and willingnessto pay for future sharing economy services, but age is negativelycorrelated. Surprisingly, we do not find that sharing economy usersare more likely to have higher trust in strangers, higher incomes,or more education.

A Qualitative Exploration of Mobile Money in Ghana,2018,"Access to formal financial services, or being financially included, allows individuals the opportunity to plan, save, and stabilize their financial lives. Financial inclusion has recently received higher priority due to its promise to improve financial well-being and, in turn, assist in the reduction of poverty on larger scales. The simultaneous success of M-Pesa, bolstered by the proliferation of mobile phone access, convinced many that mobile money would enable financial inclusion. However, with nuanced characteristics in each country and distinct financial systems and economy, mobile money adoption and usage is varied. In this paper, we evaluate the mobile money's viability as a vehicle for financial inclusion in the Southern region of Ghana. We report on qualitative interviews and observations from five different cities and surrounding small towns and evaluate individual financial practices, existing and projected needs for financial services, and the potential role of mobile money in fulfilling these goals.",COMPASS
"Multi-GCN: Graph Convolutional Networks for Multi-View Networks, with Applications to Global Poverty",2019,"With the rapid expansion of mobile phone networks in developing countries, large-scale graph machine learning has gained sudden relevance in the study of global poverty. Recent applications range from humanitarian response and poverty estimation to urban planning and epidemic containment. Yet the vast majority of computational tools and algorithms used in these applications do not account for the multi-view nature of social networks: people are related in myriad ways, but most graph learning models treat relations as binary. In this paper, we develop a graph-based convolutional network for learning on multi-view networks. We show that this method outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning algorithms on three different prediction tasks using mobile phone datasets from three different developing countries. We also show that, while designed specifically for use in poverty research, the algorithm also outperforms existing benchmarks on a broader set of learning tasks on multi-view networks, including node labelling in citation networks.",AAAI
Targeting direct cash transfers to the extremely poor,2014,"Unconditional cash transfers to the extreme poor via mobile telephony represent a radical, new approach to giving. GiveDirectly is a non-governmental organization (NGO) at the vanguard of delivering this proven and effective approach to reducing poverty. In this work, we streamline an important step in the operations of the NGO by developing and deploying a data-driven system for locating villages with extreme poverty in Kenya and Uganda. Using the type of roof of a home, thatched or metal, as a proxy for poverty, we develop a new remote sensing approach for selecting extremely poor villages to target for cash transfers. We develop an analytics algorithm that estimates housing quality and density in patches of publicly-available satellite imagery by learning a predictive model with sieves of template matching results combined with color histograms as features. We develop and deploy a crowdsourcing interface to obtain labeled training data. We deploy the predictive model to construct a fine-scale heat map of poverty and integrate this discovered knowledge into the processes of GiveDirectly's operations. Aggregating estimates at the village level, we produce a ranked list from which top villages are included in GiveDirectly's planned distribution of cash transfers. The automated approach increases village selection efficiency significantly.",KDD
"Identity At The Margins: Examining Refugee Experiences With Digital Identity Systems In Lebanon, Jordan, And Uganda",2019,"This paper examines refugees' experiences with and perspectives on the digital identity systems used by humanitarian organizations to collect, manage, and share their personal data. Through a qualitative study with 198 refugees in Lebanon, Jordan, and Uganda, we show how existing humanitarian identity systems present numerous challenges for refugees. For example, we find that refugees have little to no knowledge of the institutional systems and processes through which their personal data is managed and used. In addition, refugees are typically not able to exercise agency with regard to data that is collected about them (e.g., given choices about the data collected). At the same time, we show how refugees make active efforts to negotiate the various identities available to them, consciously weighing the benefits and constraints associated with different statuses to maximize their access to services, eligibility for employment, and spatial mobility. We use Bardzell's lens of feminist interaction design [8] to make sense of these findings and suggest a path forward that engages refugees in the design of improved identity management systems.",COMPASS
Moving Into A Technology Land: Exploring The Challenges For The Refugees In Canada In Accessing Its Computerized Infrastructures,2019,"While a growing body of literature in HCI is focusing on the initial needs of the refugees soon after their migration, most challenges associated with the long-term process of their integration with the host communities using technology have still remained understudied. This work builds on a 3 year-long fieldwork with the refugees in Canada, extended observations, and interviews with 26 participants (19 refugees, 4 refugee sponsors, and 3 refugee workers) to illustrate how refugees encounter various challenges in accessing necessary services in Canada through its computerized infrastructures. This paper documents the intricacies and nuances of this problem extended over their struggles in obtaining information, getting social support, learning new technologies, securing their digital activities, and the gender dynamics associated with these activities.

FoodSIS: a text mining system to improve the state of food safety in singapore,2014,"Food safety is an important health issue in Singapore as the number of food poisoning cases have increased significantly over the past few decades. The National Environment Agency of Singapore (NEA) is the primary government agency responsible for monitoring and mitigating the food safety risks. In an effort to pro-actively monitor emerging food safety issues and to stay abreast with developments related to food safety in the world, NEA tracks the World Wide Web as a source of news feeds to identify food safety related articles. However, such information gathering is a difficult and time consuming process due to information overload. In this paper, we present FoodSIS, a system for end-to-end web information gathering for food safety. FoodSIS improves efficiency of such focused information gathering process with the use of machine learning techniques to identify and rank relevant content. We discuss the challenges in building such a system and describe how thoughtful system design and recent advances in machine learning provide a framework that synthesizes interactive learning with classification to provide a system that is used in daily operations. We conduct experiments and demonstrate that our classification approach results in improving the efficiency by average 35% compared to a conventional approach and the ranking approach leads to average 16% improvement in elevating the ranks of relevant articles.",KDD
Learning Dynamic Context Graphs for Predicting Social Events,2019,"Event forecasting with an aim at modeling contextual information is an important task for applications such as automated analysis generation and resource allocation. Captured contextual information for an event of interest can aid human analysts in understanding the factors associated with that event. However, capturing contextual information within event forecasting is challenging due to several factors: (i) uncertainty of context structure and formulation, (ii) high dimensional features, and (iii) adaptation of features over time. Recently, graph representations have demonstrated success in applications such as traffic forecasting, social influence prediction, and visual question answering systems. In this paper, we study graph representations in modeling social events to identify dynamic properties of event contexts as social indicators. Inspired by graph neural networks, we propose a novel graph convolutional network for predicting future events (e.g., civil unrest movements). We extract and learn graph representations from historical/prior event documents. By employing the hidden word graph features, our proposed model predicts the occurrence of future events and identifies sequences of dynamic graphs as event context. Experimental results on multiple real-world data sets show that the proposed method is competitive against various state-of-the-art methods for social event prediction.",KDD
On social event organization,2014,"Online platforms, such as Meetup and Plancast, have recently become popular for planning gatherings and event organization. However, there is a surprising lack of studies on how to effectively and efficiently organize social events for a large group of people through such platforms. In this paper, we study the key computational problem involved in organization of social events, to our best knowledge, for the first time.
 We propose the Social Event Organization (SEO) problem as one of assigning a set of events for a group of users to attend, where the users are socially connected with each other and have innate levels of interest in those events. As a first step toward Social Event Organization, we introduce a formal definition of a restricted version of the problem and show that it is NP-hard and is hard to approximate. We propose efficient heuristic algorithms that improve upon simple greedy algorithms by incorporating the notion of phantom events and by using look-ahead estimation. Using synthetic datasets and three real datasets including those from the platforms Meetup and Plancast, we experimentally demonstrate that our greedy heuristics are scalable and furthermore outperform the baseline algorithms significantly in terms of achieving superior social welfare.",KDD
Detecting Vehicle Illegal Parking Events using Sharing Bikes' Trajectories,2018,"Illegal vehicle parking is a common urban problem faced by major cities in the world, as it incurs traffic jams, which lead to air pollution and traffic accidents. Traditional approaches to detect illegal vehicle parking events rely highly on active human efforts, e.g., police patrols or surveillance cameras. However, these approaches are extremely ineffective to cover a large city. The massive and high quality sharing bike trajectories from Mobike offer us with a unique opportunity to design a ubiquitous illegal parking detection system, as most of the illegal parking events happen at curbsides and have significant impact on the bike users. Two main components are employed to mine the trajectories in our system: 1)~trajectory pre-processing, which filters outlier GPS points, performs map-matching and builds indexes for bike trajectories; and 2)~illegal parking detection, which models the normal trajectories, extracts features from the evaluation trajectories and utilizes a distribution test-based method to discover the illegal parking events. The system is deployed on the cloud internally used by Mobike. Finally, extensive experiments and many insightful case studies based on the massive trajectories in Beijing are presented.",KDD
STREETS: Game-Theoretic Traffic Patrolling with Exploration and Exploitation,2014,"To dissuade reckless driving and mitigate accidents, cities deploy resources to patrol roads. In this paper, we present STREETS, an application developed for the city of Singapore, which models the problem of computing randomized traffic patrol strategies as a defender-attacker Stackelberg game. Previous work on Stackelberg security games has focused extensively on counter-terrorism settings. STREETS moves beyond counter-terrorism and represents the first use of Stackelberg games for traffic patrolling, in the process providing a novel algorithm for solving such games that addresses three major challenges in modeling and scale-up. First, there exists a high degree of unpredictability in travel times through road networks, which we capture using a Markov Decision Process for planning the patrols of the defender (the police) in the game. Second, modeling all possible police patrols and their interactions with a large number of adversaries (drivers) introduces a significant scalability challenge. To address this challenge we apply a compact game representation in a novel fashion combined with adversary and state sampling. Third, patrol strategies must balance exploitation (minimizing violations) with exploration (maximizing omnipresence), a tradeoff we model by solving a bi-objective optimization problem. We present experimental results using real-world traffic data from Singapore. This work is done in collaboration with the Singapore Ministry of Home Affairs and is currently being evaluated by the Singapore Police Force.",AAAI
No Longer Sleeping with a Bomb: A Duet System for Protecting Urban Safety from Dangerous Goods,2017,"Recent years have witnessed the continuous growth of megalopolises worldwide, which makes urban safety a top priority in modern city life. Among various threats, dangerous goods such as gas and hazardous chemicals transported through and around cities have increasingly become the deadly ""bomb"" we sleep with every day. In both academia and government, tremendous efforts have been dedicated to dealing with dangerous goods transportation (DGT) issues, but further study is still in great need to quantify the problem and explore its intrinsic dynamics in a big data perspective. In this paper, we present a novel system called DGeye, which features a ""duet"" between DGT trajectory data and human mobility data for risky zones identification. Moreover, DGeye innovatively takes risky patterns as the keystones in DGT management, and builds causality networks among them for pain point identification, attribution and prediction. Experiments on both Beijing and Tianjin cities demonstrate the effectiveness of DGeye. In particular, the report generated by DGeye driven the Beijing government to lay down gas pipelines for the famous Guijie food street.",KDD
Firebird: Predicting Fire Risk and Prioritizing Fire Inspections in Atlanta,2016,"The Atlanta Fire Rescue Department (AFRD), like many municipal fire departments, actively works to reduce fire risk by inspecting commercial properties for potential hazards and fire code violations. However, AFRD's fire inspection practices relied on tradition and intuition, with no existing data-driven process for prioritizing fire inspections or identifying new properties requiring inspection. In collaboration with AFRD, we developed the Firebird framework to help municipal fire departments identify and prioritize commercial property fire inspections, using machine learning, geocoding, and information visualization. Firebird computes fire risk scores for over 5,000 buildings in the city, with true positive rates of up to 71% in predicting fires. It has identified 6,096 new potential commercial properties to inspect, based on AFRD's criteria for inspection. Furthermore, through an interactive map, Firebird integrates and visualizes fire incidents, property information and risk scores to help AFRD make informed decisions about fire inspections. Firebird has already begun to make positive impact at both local and national levels. It is improving AFRD's inspection processes and Atlanta residents' safety, and was highlighted by National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) as a best practice for using data to inform fire inspections.",KDD
When Will You Arrive? Estimating Travel Time Based on Deep Neural Networks,2018,"Estimating the travel time of any path (denoted by a sequence of connected road segments) in a city is of great importance to traffic monitoring, route planning, ridesharing, taxi/Uber dispatching, etc. However, it is a very challenging problem, affected by diverse complex factors, including spatial correlations, temporal dependencies, external conditions (e.g. weather, traffic lights). Prior work usually focuses on estimating the travel times of individual road segments or sub-paths and then summing up these times, which leads to an inaccurate estimation because such approaches do not consider road intersections/traffic lights, and local errors may accumulate. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end Deep learning framework for Travel Time Estimation called DeepTTE that estimates the travel time of the whole path directly. More specifically, we present a geo-convolution operation by integrating the geographic information into the classical convolution, capable of capturing spatial correlations. By stacking recurrent unit on the geo-convoluton layer, our DeepTTE can capture the temporal dependencies simultaneously. A multi-task learning component is given on the top of DeepTTE, that estimates the travel time of both the entire path and each local path simultaneously during the training phase. The extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets shows our DeepTTE significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",AAAI
Functional Zone Based Hierarchical Demand Prediction For Bike System Expansion,2017,"Bike sharing systems, aiming at providing the missing links in public transportation systems, are becoming popular in urban cities. Many providers of bike sharing systems are ready to expand their bike stations from the existing service area to surrounding regions. A key to success for a bike sharing systems expansion is the bike demand prediction for expansion areas. There are two major challenges in this demand prediction problem: First. the bike transition records are not available for the expansion area and second. station level bike demand have big variances across the urban city. Previous research efforts mainly focus on discovering global features, assuming the station bike demands react equally to the global features, which brings large prediction error when the urban area is large and highly diversified. To address these challenges, in this paper, we develop a hierarchical station bike demand predictor which analyzes bike demands from functional zone level to station level. Specifically, we first divide the studied bike stations into functional zones by a novel Bi-clustering algorithm which is designed to cluster bike stations with similar POI characteristics and close geographical distances together. Then, the hourly bike check-ins and check-outs of functional zones are predicted by integrating three influential factors: distance preference, zone-to-zone preference, and zone characteristics. The station demand is estimated by studying the demand distributions among the stations within the same functional zone. Finally, the extensive experimental results on the NYC Citi Bike system with two expansion stages show the advantages of our approach on station demand and balance prediction for bike sharing system expansions.",KDD
City-Scale Map Creation and Updating using GPS Collections,2016,"Applications such as autonomous driving or real-time route recommendations require up-to-date and accurate digital maps. However, manually creating and updating such maps is too costly to meet the rising demands. As large collections of GPS trajectories become widely available, constructing and updating maps using such trajectory collections can greatly reduce the cost of such maps. Unfortunately, due to GPS noise and varying trajectory sampling rates, inferring maps from GPS trajectories can be very challenging. In this paper, we present a framework to create up-to-date maps with rich knowledge from GPS trajectory collections. Starting from an unstructured GPS point cloud, we discover road segments using novel graph-based clustering techniques with prior knowledge on road design. Based on road segments, we develop a scale- and orientation-invariant traj-SIFT feature to localize and recognize junctions using a supervised learning framework. Maps with rich knowledge are created based on discovered road segments and junctions. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach can efficiently construct high-quality maps at city scales from large collections of GPS trajectories.",KDD
Driving with knowledge from the physical world,2011,"This paper presents a Cloud-based system computing customized and practically fast driving routes for an end user using (historical and real-time) traffic conditions and driver behavior. In this system, GPS-equipped taxicabs are employed as mobile sensors constantly probing the traffic rhythm of a city and taxi drivers' intelligence in choosing driving directions in the physical world. Meanwhile, a Cloud aggregates and mines the information from these taxis and other sources from the Internet, like Web maps and weather forecast. The Cloud builds a model incorporating day of the week, time of day, weather conditions, and individual driving strategies (both of the taxi drivers and of the end user for whom the route is being computed). Using this model, our system predicts the traffic conditions of a future time (when the computed route is actually driven) and performs a self-adaptive driving direction service for a particular user. This service gradually learns a user's driving behavior from the user's GPS logs and customizes the fastest route for the user with the help of the Cloud. We evaluate our service using a real-world dataset generated by over 33,000 taxis over a period of 3 months in Beijing. As a result, our service accurately estimates the travel time of a route for a user; hence finding the fastest route customized for the user.",KDD
Efficient and Effective Express via Contextual Cooperative Reinforcement Learning,2019,"Express systems are widely deployed in many major cities. Couriers in an express system load parcels at transit station and deliver them to customers. Meanwhile, they also try to serve the pick-up requests which come stochastically in real time during the delivery process. Having brought much convenience and promoted the development of e-commerce, express systems face challenges on courier management to complete the massive number of tasks per day. Considering this problem, we propose a reinforcement learning based framework to learn a courier management policy. Firstly, we divide the city into independent regions, in each of which a constant number of couriers deliver parcels and serve requests cooperatively. Secondly, we propose a soft-label clustering algorithm named Balanced Delivery-Service Burden (BDSB) to dispatch parcels to couriers in each region. BDSB guarantees that each courier has almost even delivery and expected request-service burden when departing from transit station, giving a reasonable initialization for online management later. As pick-up requests come in real time, a Contextual Cooperative Reinforcement Learning (CCRL) model is proposed to guide where should each courier deliver and serve in each short period. Being formulated in a multi-agent way, CCRL focuses on the cooperation among couriers while also considering the system context. Experiments on real-world data from Beijing are conducted to confirm the outperformance of our model.",KDD
A Hybrid Approach to Convoy Movement Planning in an Urban City,2008,"In this paper, we consider a high-fidelity Convoy Movement Problem motivated by the coordination and routing of convoys within a road transportation network in an urban city. It encompasses two classical combinatorial optimization problems - vehicle routing and resource constrained scheduling. We present an effective hybrid algorithm to dynamically manage the movement of convoys, where we combine the standard Dijkstraâs shortest-path algorithm with constraint programming techniques. The effectiveness of the algorithm is illustrated with testing on varying problem sizes and complexity.",AAAI
Inferring Metapopulation Propagation Network for Intra-city Epidemic Control and Prevention,2018,"Since the 21st century, the global outbreaks of infectious diseases such as SARS in 2003, H1N1 in 2009, and H7N9 in 2013, have become the critical threat to the public health and a hunting nightmare to the government. Understanding the propagation in large-scale metapopulations and predicting the future outbreaks thus become crucially important for epidemic control and prevention. In the literature, there have been a bulk of studies on modeling intra-city epidemic propagation but with the single population assumption (homogeneity). Some recent works on metapopulation propagation, however, focus on finding specific human mobility physical networks to approximate diseases transmission networks, whose generality to fit different diseases cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, we argue that the intra-city epidemic propagation should be modeled on a metapopulation base, and propose a two-step method for this purpose. The first step is to understand the propagation system by inferring the underlying disease infection network. To this end, we propose a novel network inference model called D 2 PRI, which reduces the individual network into a sub-population network without information loss, and incorporates the power-law distribution prior and data prior for better performance. The second step is to predict the disease propagation by extending the classic SIR model to a metapopulation SIR model that allows visitors transmission between any two sub-populations. The validity of our model is testified on a real-life clinical report data set about the airborne disease in the Shenzhen city, China. The D 2 PRI model with the extended SIR model exhibit superior performance in various tasks including network inference, infection prediction and outbreaks simulation.",KDD
Learning to Prescribe Interventions for Tuberculosis Patients Using Digital Adherence Data,2019,"Digital Adherence Technologies (DATs) are an increasingly popular method for verifying patient adherence to many medications. We analyze data from one city served by 99DOTS, a phone-call-based DAT deployed for Tuberculosis (TB) treatment in India where nearly 3 million people are afflicted with the disease each year. The data contains nearly 17,000 patients and 2.1M dose records. We lay the groundwork for learning from this real-world data, including a method for avoiding the effects of unobserved interventions in training data used for machine learning. We then construct a deep learning model, demonstrate its interpretability, and show how it can be adapted and trained in three different clinical scenarios to better target and improve patient care. In the real-time risk prediction setting our model could be used to proactively intervene with 21% more patients and before 76% more missed doses than current heuristic baselines. For outcome prediction, our model performs 40% better than baseline methods, allowing cities to target more resources to clinics with a heavier burden of patients at risk of failure. Finally, we present a case study demonstrating how our model can be trained in an end-to-end decision focused learning setting to achieve 15% better solution quality in an example decision problem faced by health workers.",KDD
A Large-Scale Study on Predicting and Contextualizing Building Energy Usage,2011,"In this paper we present a data-driven approach to modeling end user energy consumption in residential and commercial buildings. Our model is based upon a data set of monthly electricity and gas bills, collected by a utility over the course of several years, for approximately 6,500 buildings in Cambridge, MA. In addition, we use publicly available tax assessor records and geographical survey information to determine corresponding features for the buildings. Using both parametric and non-parametric learning methods, we learn models that predict distributions over energy usage based upon these features, and use these models to develop two end-user systems. For utilities or authorized institutions (those who may obtain access to the full data) we provide a system that visualizes energy consumption for each building in the city; this allows companies to quickly identify outliers (buildings which use much more energy than expected even after conditioning on the relevant predictors), for instance allowing them to target homes for potential retrofits or tiered pricing schemes. For other end users, we provide an interface for entering their own electricity and gas usage, along with basic information about their home, to determine how their consumption compares to that of similar buildings as predicted by our model. Merely allowing users to contextualize their consumption in this way, relating it to the consumption in similar buildings, can itself produce behavior changes to significantly reduce consumption.",AAAI
A Region-Based Model for Estimating Urban Air Pollution,2014,"Air pollution has a direct impact to human health, and data-driven air quality models are useful for evaluating population exposure to air pollutants. In this paper, we propose a novel region-based Gaussian process model for estimating urban air pollution dispersion, and applied it to a large dataset of ultrafine particle (UFP) measurements collected from a network of sensors located on several trams in the city of Zurich. We show that compared to existing grid-based models, the region-based model produces better predictions across aggregates of all time scales. The new model is appropriate for many useful user applications such as exposure assessment and anomaly detection.",AAAI
DeepRoof: A Data-driven Approach For Solar Potential Estimation Using Rooftop Imagery,2019,"Rooftop solar deployments are an excellent source for generating clean energy. As a result, their popularity among homeowners has grown significantly over the years. Unfortunately, estimating the solar potential of a roof requires homeowners to consult solar consultants, who manually evaluate the site. Recently there have been efforts to automatically estimate the solar potential for any roof within a city. However, current methods work only for places where LIDAR data is available, thereby limiting their reach to just a few places in the world. In this paper, we propose DeepRoof, a data-driven approach that uses widely available satellite images to assess the solar potential of a roof. Using satellite images, DeepRoof determines the roof's geometry and leverages publicly available real-estate and solar irradiance data to provide a pixel-level estimate of the solar potential for each planar roof segment. Such estimates can be used to identify ideal locations on the roof for installing solar panels. Further, we evaluate our approach on an annotated roof dataset, validate the results with solar experts and compare it to a LIDAR-based approach. Our results show that DeepRoof can accurately extract the roof geometry such as the planar roof segments and their orientation, achieving a true positive rate of 91.1% in identifying roofs and a low mean orientation error of 9.3 degree. We also show that DeepRoof's median estimate of the available solar installation area is within 11% of a LIDAR-based approach.",KDD
A Dynamic Pipeline for Spatio-Temporal Fire Risk Prediction,2018,"Recent high-profile fire incidents in cities around the world have highlighted gaps in fire risk reduction efforts, as cities grapple with fewer resources and more properties to safeguard. To address this resource gap, prior work has developed machine learning frameworks to predict fire risk and prioritize fire inspections. However, existing approaches were limited by not including time-varying data, never deploying in real-time, and only predicting risk for a small subset of commercial properties in their city. Here, we have developed a predictive risk framework for all 20,636 commercial properties in Pittsburgh, based on time-varying data from a variety of municipal agencies. We have deployed our fire risk model on Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire's (PBF), and we have developed preliminary risk models for residential property fire risk prediction. Our commercial risk model outperforms the prior state of the art with a kappa of 0.33 compared to their 0.17, and is able to be applied to nearly 4 times as many properties as the prior model. In the 5 weeks since our model was first deployed, 58% of our predicted high-risk properties had a fire incident of any kind, while 23% of the building fire incidents that occurred took place in our predicted high or medium risk properties. The risk scores from our commercial model are visualized on an interactive dashboard and map to assist the PBF with planning their fire risk reduction initiatives. This work is already helping to improve fire risk reduction in Pittsburgh and is beginning to be adopted by other cities.",KDD
Inferring gas consumption and pollution emission of vehicles throughout a city,2014,"This paper instantly infers the gas consumption and pollution emission of vehicles traveling on a city's road network in a current time slot, using GPS trajectories from a sample of vehicles (e.g., taxicabs). The knowledge can be used to suggest cost-efficient driving routes as well as identifying road segments where gas has been wasted significantly. The instant estimation of the emissions from vehicles can enable pollution alerts and help diagnose the root cause of air pollution in the long run. In our method, we first compute the travel speed of each road segment using the GPS trajectories received recently. As many road segments are not traversed by trajectories (i.e., data sparsity), we propose a Travel Speed Estimation (TSE) model based on a context-aware matrix factorization approach. TSE leverages features learned from other data sources, e.g., map data and historical trajectories, to deal with the data sparsity problem. We then propose a Traffic Volume Inference (TVI) model to infer the number of vehicles passing each road segment per minute. TVI is an unsupervised Bayesian Network that incorporates multiple factors, such as travel speed, weather conditions and geographical features of a road. Given the travel speed and traffic volume of a road segment, gas consumption and emissions can be calculated based on existing environmental theories. We evaluate our method based on extensive experiments using GPS trajectories generated by over 32,000 taxis in Beijing over a period of two months. The results demonstrate the advantages of our method over baselines, validating the contribution of its components and finding interesting discoveries for the benefit of society.",KDD
Travel time estimation of a path using sparse trajectories,2014,"In this paper, we propose a citywide and real-time model for estimating the travel time of any path (represented as a sequence of connected road segments) in real time in a city, based on the GPS trajectories of vehicles received in current time slots and over a period of history as well as map data sources. Though this is a strategically important task in many traffic monitoring and routing systems, the problem has not been well solved yet given the following three challenges. The first is the data sparsity problem, i.e., many road segments may not be traveled by any GPS-equipped vehicles in present time slot. In most cases, we cannot find a trajectory exactly traversing a query path either. Second, for the fragment of a path with trajectories, they are multiple ways of using (or combining) the trajectories to estimate the corresponding travel time. Finding an optimal combination is a challenging problem, subject to a tradeoff between the length of a path and the number of trajectories traversing the path (i.e., support). Third, we need to instantly answer users' queries which may occur in any part of a given city. This calls for an efficient, scalable and effective solution that can enable a citywide and real-time travel time estimation. To address these challenges, we model different drivers' travel times on different road segments in different time slots with a three dimension tensor. Combined with geospatial, temporal and historical contexts learned from trajectories and map data, we fill in the tensor's missing values through a context-aware tensor decomposition approach. We then devise and prove an object function to model the aforementioned tradeoff, with which we find the most optimal concatenation of trajectories for an estimate through a dynamic programming solution. In addition, we propose using frequent trajectory patterns (mined from historical trajectories) to scale down the candidates of concatenation and a suffix-tree-based index to manage the trajectories received in the present time slot. We evaluate our method based on extensive experiments, using GPS trajectories generated by more than 32,000 taxis over a period of two months. The results demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and scalability of our method beyond baseline approaches.",KDD
Predicting the Spatio-Temporal Evolution of Chronic Diseases in Population with Human Mobility Data,2018,"Chronic diseases like cancer and diabetes are major threats to human life. Understanding the distribution and progression of chronic diseases of a population is important in assisting the allocation of medical resources as well as the design of policies in preemptive healthcare. Traditional methods to obtain large scale indicators on population health, e.g., surveys and statistical analysis, can be costly and time-consuming and often lead to a coarse spatio-temporal picture. In this paper, we leverage a dataset describing the human mobility patterns of citizens in a large metropolitan area. By viewing local human lifestyles we predict the evolution rate of several chronic diseases at the level of a city neighborhood. We apply the combination of a collaborative topic modeling (CTM) and a Gaussian mixture method (GMM) to tackle the data sparsity challenge and achieve robust predictions on health conditions simultaneously. Our method enables the analysis and prediction of disease rate evolution at fine spatio-temporal scales and demonstrates the potential of incorporating datasets from mobile web sources to improve population health monitoring. Evaluations using real-world check-in and chronic disease morbidity datasets in the city of London show that the proposed CTM+GMM model outperforms various baseline methods.",IJCAI
Inferring Air Quality for Station Location Recommendation Based on Urban Big Data,2015,"This paper tries to answer two questions. First, how to infer real-time air quality of any arbitrary location given environmental data and historical air quality data from very sparse monitoring locations. Second, if one needs to establish few new monitoring stations to improve the inference quality, how to determine the best locations for such purpose? The problems are challenging since for most of the locations (>99%) in a city we do not have any air quality data to train a model from. We design a semi-supervised inference model utilizing existing monitoring data together with heterogeneous city dynamics, including meteorology, human mobility, structure of road networks, and point of interests (POIs). We also propose an entropy-minimization model to suggest the best locations to establish new monitoring stations. We evaluate the proposed approach using Beijing air quality data, resulting in clear advantages over a series of state-of-the-art and commonly used methods.",KDD
Mining mobility data to minimise travellers' spending on public transport,2011,"As the public transport infrastructure of large cities expands, transport operators are diversifying the range and prices of tickets that can be purchased for travel. However, selecting the best fare for each individual traveller's needs is a complex process that is left almost completely unaided. By examining the relation between urban mobility and fare purchasing habits in large datasets from London, England's public transport network, we estimate that travellers in the city cumulatively spend, per year, up to approximately GBP 200 million more than they need to, as a result of purchasing the incorrect fares. We propose to address these incorrect purchases by leveraging the huge volumes of data that travellers create as they move about the city, by providing, to each of them, personalised ticket recommendations based on their estimated future travel patterns. In this work, we explore the viability of building a fare-recommendation system for public transport networks by (a) formalising the problem as two separate prediction problems and (b) evaluating a number of algorithms that aim to match travellers to the best fare. We find that applying data mining techniques to public transport data has the potential to provide travellers with substantial savings.",KDD
U-Air: when urban air quality inference meets big data,2013,"Information about urban air quality, e.g., the concentration of PM2.5, is of great importance to protect human health and control air pollution. While there are limited air-quality-monitor-stations in a city, air quality varies in urban spaces non-linearly and depends on multiple factors, such as meteorology, traffic volume, and land uses. In this paper, we infer the real-time and fine-grained air quality information throughout a city, based on the (historical and real-time) air quality data reported by existing monitor stations and a variety of data sources we observed in the city, such as meteorology, traffic flow, human mobility, structure of road networks, and point of interests (POIs). We propose a semi-supervised learning approach based on a co-training framework that consists of two separated classifiers. One is a spatial classifier based on an artificial neural network (ANN), which takes spatially-related features (e.g., the density of POIs and length of highways) as input to model the spatial correlation between air qualities of different locations. The other is a temporal classifier based on a linear-chain conditional random field (CRF), involving temporally-related features (e.g., traffic and meteorology) to model the temporal dependency of air quality in a location. We evaluated our approach with extensive experiments based on five real data sources obtained in Beijing and Shanghai. The results show the advantages of our method over four categories of baselines, including linear/Gaussian interpolations, classical dispersion models, well-known classification models like decision tree and CRF, and ANN.",KDD
Where Will Dockless Shared Bikes be Stacked?: --- Parking Hotspots Detection in a New City,2018,"Dockless shared bikes, which aim at providing a more flexible and convenient solution to the first-and-last mile connection, come into China and expand to other countries at a very impressing speed. The expansion of shared bike business in new cities brings many challenges among which, the most critical one is the parking chaos caused by too many bikes yet insufficient demands. To allow possible actions to be taken in advance, this paper studies the problem of detecting parking hotspots in a new city where no dockless shared bike has been deployed. We propose to measure road hotness by bike density with the help of the Kernal Density Estimation. We extract useful features from multi-source urban data and introduce a novel domain adaption network for transferring hotspots knowledge learned from one city with shared bikes to a new city. The extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared with various baselines.",KDD
Du-Parking: Spatio-Temporal Big Data Tells You Realtime Parking Availability,2018,"Realtime parking availability information is of great importance to help drivers to find a parking space faster and thus to reduce parking search traffic. While there are limited realtime parking availability systems in a city due to the expensive cost of sensor device and maintaining realtime parking information. In this paper, we estimate the realtime parking availability throughout a city using historical parking availability data reported by a limited number of existing sensors of parking lots and a variety of datasets we observed in the city, such as meteorology, events, map mobility trace data and navigation data from Baidu map, and POIs. We propose a deep-learning-based approach, called Du-Parking, which consists of three major components modeling temporal closeness, period and current general influence, respectively. More specifically, we employ long short-term memory (LSTM) to model the temporal closeness and period, and meanwhile using two fully-connected layers to model the current general factors. Our approach learns to dynamically aggregate the output of the three components, to estimate the final parking availability of given parking lot. Using the proposed approach, we have provided the realtime parking availability information in Baidu map app, in nine cities in China. We evaluated our approach in Beijing and Shenzhen. The results show the advantages of our method over two categories of baselines, including linear interpolations, and the well-known classification model like GBDT.",KDD
ParkUs: A Novel Vehicle Parking Detection System,2017,"Finding on-street parking in congested urban areas is a challenging chore that most drivers worldwide dislike. Previousvehicle traffic studies have estimated that around thirty percent of vehicles travelling in inner city areas are made up ofdrivers searching for a vacant parking space. While there arehardware sensor based solutions to monitor on-street parking occupancy in real-time, instrumenting and maintainingsuch a city wide system is a substantial investment. In this paper, a novel vehicle parking activity detection method, calledParkUs, is introduced and tested with the aim to eventuallyreduce vacant car parking space search times. The systemutilises accelerometer and magnetometer sensors found in allsmartphones in order to detect parking activity within a cityenvironment. Moreover, it uses a novel sensor fusion featurecalled the Orthogonality Error Estimate (OEE). We show thatthe OEE is an excellent indicator as itÃ¢â¬â¢s capable of detecting parking activities with high accuracy and low energy consumption. One of the envisioned applications of the ParkUssystem will be to provide all drivers with guidelines on wherethey are most likely to find vacant parking spaces within acity. Therefore, reducing the time required to find a vacantparking space and subsequently vehicle congestion and emissions within the city.",AAAI
Combining Satellite Imagery and Open Data to Map Road Safety,2017,"Improving road safety is critical for the sustainable development of cities. A road safety map is a powerful tool that can help prevent future traffic accidents. However, accurate mapping requires accurate data collection, which is both expensive and labor intensive. Satellite imagery is increasingly becoming abundant, higher in resolution and affordable. Given the recent successes deep learning has achieved in the visual recognition field, we are interested in investigating whether it is possible to use deep learning to accurately predict road safety directly from raw satellite imagery. To this end, we propose a deep learning-based mapping approach that leverages open data to learn from raw satellite imagery robust deep models able to predict accurate city-scale road safety maps at an affordable cost. To empirically validate the proposed approach, we trained a deep model on satellite images obtained from over 647 thousand traffic-accident reports collected over a period of four years by the New York city Police Department. The best model predicted road safety from raw satellite imagery with an accuracy of 78%. We also used the New York city model to predict for the city of Denver a city-scale map indicating road safety in three levels. Compared to a map made from three years' worth of data collected by the Denver city Police Department, the map predicted from raw satellite imagery has an accuracy of 73%.",AAAI
Real-time Adaptive Tolling Scheme for Optimized Social Welfare in Traffic Networks (Page 828),2017,"Connected and autonomous vehicle technology has advanced rapidly in recent years. These technologies create possibilities for advanced AI-based traffic management techniques. Developing such techniques is an important challenge and opportunity for the AI community as it requires synergy between experts in game theory, multiagent systems, behavioral science, and flow optimization. This paper takes a step in this direction by considering traffic flow optimization through setting and broadcasting of dynamic and adaptive tolls. Previous tolling schemes either were not adaptive in realtime, not scalable to large networks, or did not optimize traffic flow over an entire network. Moreover, previous schemes made strong assumptions on observable demands, road capacities and users homogeneity. This paper introduces â³-tolling, a novel tolling scheme that is adaptive in real-time and able to scale to large networks. We provide theoretical evidence showing that under certain assumptions â³-tolling is equal to Marginal-Cost Tolling, which provably leads to system-optimal, and empirical evidence showing that â³-tolling increases social welfare (by up to 33%) in two traffic simulators with markedly different modeling assumptions.",AAMAS
Algorithmic Bias: From Discrimination Discovery to Fairness-aware Data Mining,2016,"Algorithms and decision making based on Big Data have become pervasive in all aspects of our daily lives lives (offline and online), as they have become essential tools in personal finance, health care, hiring, housing, education, and policies. It is therefore of societal and ethical importance to ask whether these algorithms can be discriminative on grounds such as gender, ethnicity, or health status. It turns out that the answer is positive: for instance, recent studies in the context of online advertising show that ads for high-income jobs are presented to men much more often than to women [Datta et al., 2015]; and ads for arrest records are significantly more likely to show up on searches for distinctively black names [Sweeney, 2013]. This algorithmic bias exists even when there is no discrimination intention in the developer of the algorithm. Sometimes it may be inherent to the data sources used (software making decisions based on data can reflect, or even amplify, the results of historical discrimination), but even when the sensitive attributes have been suppressed from the input, a well trained machine learning algorithm may still discriminate on the basis of such sensitive attributes because of correlations existing in the data. These considerations call for the development of data mining systems which are discrimination-conscious by-design. This is a novel and challenging research area for the data mining community.
 The aim of this tutorial is to survey algorithmic bias, presenting its most common variants, with an emphasis on the algorithmic techniques and key ideas developed to derive efficient solutions. The tutorial covers two main complementary approaches: algorithms for discrimination discovery and discrimination prevention by means of fairness-aware data mining. We conclude by summarizing promising paths for future research.",KDD
Agents vs. Pirates: Multi-agent Simulation and Optimization to Fight Maritime Piracy,2012,"Contemporary maritime piracy presents a significant threat to the global shipping industry, with annual costs estimated at up to US$12bn. To address the threat, commanders and policymakers need new data-driven decision-support tools that will allow them to plan and execute counter-piracy activities most effectively. So far, however, the provision of such tools has been very limited. To fill this gap, we have employed the multi-agent approach and developed a novel suite of computational tools and techniques for operational management of counter-piracy operations. A comprehensive agent-based simulation enables the stakeholders to assess the efficiency of a range of piracy counter-measures, including recommended transit corridors, escorted convoys, group transit schemes, route randomization and navy patrol deployments. Decision-theoretic and game-theoretic optimization techniques further assist in discovering counter-measure configurations that yield the best trade-off between transportation security and cost. We demonstrate our approach on two case studies based on the problems and solutions currently explored by the maritime security community. Our work is the first integrated application of agent-based techniques to high-seas maritime security and opens a wide range of directions for follow-up research and development.",AAMAS
Internet Device Graphs,2017,"Internet device graphs identify relationships between user-centric internet connected devices such as desktops, laptops, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, TV's, etc. The ability to create such graphs is compelling for online advertising, content customization, recommendation systems, security, and operations. We begin by describing an algorithm for generating a device graph based on IP-colocation, and then apply the algorithm to a corpus of over 2.5 trillion internet events collected over the period of six weeks in the United States. The resulting graph exhibits immense scale with greater than 7.3 billion edges (pair-wise relationships) between more than 1.2 billion nodes (devices), accounting for the vast majority of internet connected devices in the US. Next, we apply community detection algorithms to the graph resulting in a partitioning of internet devices into 100 million small communities representing physical households. We validate this partition with a unique ground truth dataset. We report on the characteristics of the graph and the communities. Lastly, we discuss the important issues of ethics and privacy that must be considered when creating and studying device graphs, and suggest further opportunities for device graph enrichment and application.",KDD
PROTECT: A Deployed Game Theoretic System to Protect the Ports of the United States,2012,"While three deployed applications of game theory for security have recently been reported at AAMAS [12], we as a community remain in the early stages of these deployments; there is a continuing need to understand the core principles for innovative security applications of game theory. Towards that end, this paper presents PROTECT, a game-theoretic system deployed by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) in the port of Boston for scheduling their patrols. USCG has termed the deployment of PROTECT in Boston a success, and efforts are underway to test it in the port of New York, with the potential for nationwide deployment. PROTECT is premised on an attacker-defender Stackelberg game model and offers five key innovations. First, this system is a departure from the assumption of perfect adversary rationality noted in previous work, relying instead on a quantal response (QR) model of the adversary's behavior --- to the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-world deployment of the QR model. Second, to improve PROTECT's efficiency, we generate a compact representation of the defender's strategy space, exploiting equivalence and dominance. Third, we show how to practically model a real maritime patrolling problem as a Stackelberg game. Fourth, our experimental results illustrate that PROTECT's QR model more robustly handles real-world uncertainties than a perfect rationality model. Finally, in evaluating PROTECT, this paper for the first time provides real-world data: (i) comparison of human-generated vs PROTECT security schedules, and (ii) results from an Adversarial Perspective Team's (human mock attackers) analysis.",AAMAS
Testing Cyber Security with Simulated Humans,2011,"Human error is one of the most common causes of vulnerability in asecure system. However it is often overlooked when these systems aretested, partly because human tests are costly and very hard torepeat. We have developed a community of agents that test securesystems by running standard windows software while performingcollaborative group tasks, mimicking more realistic patterns ofcommunication and traffic, as well as human fatigue and errors. Thissystem is being deployed on a large cyber testing range. One keyattribute of humans is flexibility of response in order to achievetheir goals when unexpected events occur. Our agents use reactiveplanning within a BDI architecture to flexibly re-plan if needed.Since the agents are goal-oriented, we are able to measure the impactof cyber attacks on mission accomplishment, a more salient measure ofprotection than raw penetration. We show experimentally how the agentteams can be resilient under attacks that are partly successful, andalso how an organizational structure can lead to emergent propertiesof the traffic in the network.",AAAI
Hierarchical Graph-Coupled HMMs for Heterogeneous Personalized Health Data,2015,"The purpose of this study is to leverage modern technology (mobile or web apps) to enrich epidemiology data and infer the transmission of disease. We develop hierarchical Graph-Coupled Hidden Markov Models (hGCHMMs) to simultaneously track the spread of infection in a small cell phone community and capture person-specific infection parameters by leveraging a link prior that incorporates additional covariates. In this paper we investigate two link functions, the beta-exponential link and sigmoid link, both of which allow the development of a principled Bayesian hierarchical framework for disease transmission. The results of our model allow us to predict the probability of infection for each persons on each day, and also to infer personal physical vulnerability and the relevant association with covariates. We demonstrate our approach theoretically and experimentally on both simulation data and real epidemiological records.",KDD
Discovering spatio-temporal causal interactions in traffic data streams,2011,"The detection of outliers in spatio-temporal traffic data is an important research problem in the data mining and knowledge discovery community. However to the best of our knowledge, the discovery of relationships, especially causal interactions, among detected traffic outliers has not been investigated before. In this paper we propose algorithms which construct outlier causality trees based on temporal and spatial properties of detected outliers. Frequent substructures of these causality trees reveal not only recurring interactions among spatio-temporal outliers, but potential flaws in the design of existing traffic networks. The effectiveness and strength of our algorithms are validated by experiments on a very large volume of real taxi trajectories in an urban road network.",KDD
Local Search for Designing Noise-Minimal Rotorcraft Approach Trajectories,2012,"NASA and the international community are investing in the development of a commercial transportation infrastructure that includes the increased use of rotorcraft, specifically heli- copters and civil tilt rotors. However, there is significant con- cern over the impact of noise on the communities surrounding the transportation facilities. One way to address the rotorcraft noise problem is by exploiting powerful search techniques coming from artificial intelligence coupled with simulation and field tests to design low-noise flight profiles which can be tested in simulation or through field tests. This paper in- vestigates the use of simulation based on predictive physical models to facilitate the search for low-noise trajectories using local search combined with a robust noise simulator.",AAAI
Dual beta process priors for latent cluster discovery in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,2014,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease characterized by airflow limitation usually associated with an inflammatory response to noxious particles, such as cigarette smoke. COPD is currently the third leading cause of death in the United States and is the only leading cause of death that is increasing in prevalence. It also represents an enormous financial burden to society, costing tens of billions of dollars annually in the U.S. It is widely accepted by the medical community that COPD is a heterogeneous disease, with substantial evidence indicating that genetic variation contributes to varying levels of disease susceptibility. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. Although researchers have made several attempts to discover disease subtypes, results have been inconclusive, in part because standard clustering methods have not properly dealt with disease manifestations that may worsen with increased exposure. In this paper we introduce a transformative way of looking at the COPD subtyping task. Specifically, we model the relationship between risk factors (such as age and smoke exposure) and manifestations of disease severity using Gaussian Processes, which allow us to represent so-called ""disease trajectories"". We also posit that individuals can be associated with multiple disease types (latent clusters), which we assume are influenced by genetics. Furthermore, we predict that only subsets of the numerous disease-related quantitative features are useful for describing each latent subtype. We model these associations using two separate beta process priors, and we describe a variational inference approach to discover the most probable latent cluster assignments. Results are validated with associations to genetic markers.",KDD
Prognosis and Diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease Using Multi-Task Learning,2017,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease excessively affecting millions of patients. Early diagnosis of PD is critical as manifestation of symptoms occur many years after the onset of neurodegenration, when more than 60\% of dopaminergic neurons are lost. Since there is no definite diagnosis of PD, the early management of disease is a significant challenge in the field of PD therapeutics. Therefore, identifying valid biomarkers that can characterize the progression of PD has lately received growing attentions in PD research community. In this paper, we employ a multi-task learning regression framework for prediction of Parkinson's disease progression, where each task is the prediction of PD rating scales at one future time point. We then use the model to identify the important biomarkers predictive of disease progression. We adopt a graph regularization approach to capture the relationship between different tasks and penalize large variations of the model at consecutive future time points. We have carried out comprehensive experiments using different categories of measurements at baseline from Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database to predict the severity of PD, measured by unified PD rating scale. We use the learned model to identify the biomarkers with significant contribution in prediction of PD progression. Our results confirm some of the important biomarkers identified in existing medical studies, validate some of the biomarkers that have been observed as a potential marker of PD and discover new biomarkers that have not yet been investigated.",KDD
"The interplay between dynamics and networks: centrality, communities, and cheeger inequality",2014,"We study the interplay between a dynamic process and the structure of the network on which it is defined. Specifically, we examine the impact of this interaction on the quality-measure of network clusters and node centrality. This enables us to effectively identify network communities and important nodes participating in the dynamics. As the first step towards this objective, we introduce an umbrella framework for defining and characterizing an ensemble of dynamic processes on a network. This framework generalizes the traditional Laplacian framework to continuous-time biased random walks and also allows us to model some epidemic processes over a network. For each dynamic process in our framework, we can define a function that measures the quality of every subset of nodes as a potential cluster (or community) with respect to this process on a given network. This subset-quality function generalizes the traditional conductance measure for graph partitioning. We partially justify our choice of the quality function by showing that the classic Cheeger's inequality, which relates the conductance of the best cluster in a network with a spectral quantity of its Laplacian matrix, can be extended from the Laplacian-conductance setting to this more general setting.",KDD
Multi-source learning with block-wise missing data for Alzheimer's disease prediction,2013,"With the advances and increasing sophistication in data collection techniques, we are facing with large amounts of data collected from multiple heterogeneous sources in many applications. For example, in the study of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), different types of measurements such as neuroimages, gene/protein expression data, genetic data etc. are often collected and analyzed together for improved predictive power. It is believed that a joint learning of multiple data sources is beneficial as different data sources may contain complementary information, and feature-pruning and data source selection are critical for learning interpretable models from high-dimensional data. Very often the collected data comes with block-wise missing entries; for example, a patient without the MRI scan will have no information in the MRI data block, making his/her overall record incomplete. There has been a growing interest in the data mining community on expanding traditional techniques for single-source complete data analysis to the study of multi-source incomplete data. The key challenge is how to effectively integrate information from multiple heterogeneous sources in the presence of block-wise missing data. In this paper we first investigate the situation of complete data and present a unified ``bi-level"" learning model for multi-source data. Then we give a natural extension of this model to the more challenging case with incomplete data. Our major contributions are threefold: (1) the proposed models handle both feature-level and source-level analysis in a unified formulation and include several existing feature learning approaches as special cases; (2) the model for incomplete data avoids direct imputation of the missing elements and thus provides superior performances. Moreover, it can be easily generalized to other applications with block-wise missing data sources; (3) efficient optimization algorithms are presented for both the complete and incomplete models. We have performed comprehensive evaluations of the proposed models on the application of AD diagnosis. Our proposed models compare favorably against existing approaches.",KDD
Learning the Probability of Activation in the Presence of Latent Spreaders,2018,"When an infection spreads in a community, an individual's probability of becoming infected depends on both her susceptibility and exposure to the contagion through contact with others. While one often has knowledge regarding an individual's susceptibility, in many cases, whether or not an individual's contacts are contagious is unknown.We study the problem of predicting if an individual will adopt a contagion in the presence of multiple modes of infection (exposure/susceptibility) and latent neighbor influence. We present a generative probabilistic model and a variational inference method to learn the parameters of our model. Through a series of experiments on synthetic data, we measure the ability of the proposed model to identify latent spreaders, and predict the risk of infection. Applied to a real dataset of 20,000 hospital patients, we demonstrate the utility of our model in predicting the onset of a healthcare associated infection using patient room-sharing and nurse-sharing networks. Our model outperforms existing benchmarks and provides actionable insights for the design and implementation of targeted interventions to curb the spread of infection.",AAAI
MOLIERE: Automatic Biomedical Hypothesis Generation System,2017,"Hypothesis generation is becoming a crucial time-saving technique which allows biomedical researchers to quickly discover implicit connections between important concepts. Typically, these systems operate on domain-specific fractions of public medical data. MOLIERE, in contrast, utilizes information from over 24.5 million documents and does not limit the document vocabulary. At the heart of our approach lies a multi-modal and multi-relational network of biomedical objects extracted from several heterogeneous datasets from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). These objects include but are not limited to scientific papers, keywords, genes, proteins, diseases, and diagnoses. We model hypotheses using Latent Dirichlet Allocation applied on abstracts found near shortest paths discovered within this network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MOLIERE by performing hypothesis generation on historical data. Our network, implementation, and resulting data are all publicly available for the broad scientific community.",KDD
Privacy-Preserving Distributed Multi-Task Learning with Asynchronous Updates,2017,"Many data mining applications involve a set of related learning tasks. Multi-task learning (MTL) is a learning paradigm that improves generalization performance by transferring knowledge among those tasks. MTL has attracted so much attention in the community, and various algorithms have been successfully developed. Recently, distributed MTL has also been studied for related tasks whose data is distributed across different geographical regions. One prominent challenge of the distributed MTL frameworks is to maintain the privacy of the data. The distributed data may contain sensitive and private information such as patients' records and registers of a company. In such cases, distributed MTL frameworks are required to preserve the privacy of the data. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving distributed MTL framework to address this challenge. A privacy-preserving proximal gradient algorithm, which asynchronously updates models of the learning tasks, is introduced to solve a general class of MTL formulations. The proposed asynchronous approach is robust against network delays and provides a guaranteed differential privacy through carefully designed perturbation. Theoretical guarantees of the proposed algorithm are derived and supported by the extensive experimental results.",KDD
Avicaching: A Two Stage Game for Bias Reduction in Citizen Science (Page 776),2016,"Citizen science projects have been very successful at collecting rich datasets for different applications. However, the data collected by the citizen scientists are often biased, more aligned with the citizens' preferences rather than scientific objectives. We introduce a novel two-stage game for reducing data-bias in citizen science in which the game organizer, a citizen-science program, incentivizes the agents, the citizen scientists, to visit under-sampled areas. We provide a novel way of encoding this two-stage game as a single optimization problem, cleverly folding (an approximation of) the agents' problems into the organizer's problem. We present several new algorithms to solve this optimization problem as well as a new structural SVM approach to learn the parameters that capture the agents' behaviors, under different incentive schemes. We apply our methodology to eBird, a well-established citizen-science program for collecting bird observations, as a game called Avicaching. We deployed Avicaching in two New York counties (March 2015), with a great response from the birding community, surpassing the expectations of the eBird organizers and bird-conservation experts. The field results show that the Avicaching incentives are remarkably effective at encouraging the bird watchers to explore under-sampled areas and hence alleviate the eBird's data bias problem.",AAMAS
Factored MDPS for Optimal Prosumer Decision-Making (Page 503),2015,"Tackling the decision-making problem faced by a prosumer (i.e., a producer that is simultaneously a consumer) when selling and buying energy in the emerging smart electricity grid, is of utmost importance for the economic profitability of such a business entity. In this paper, we model, for the first time, this problem as a factored Markov Decision Process. By so doing, we are able to represent the problem compactly, and provide an exact optimal solution via dynamic programming - notwithstanding its large size. Our model successfully captures the main aspects of the business decisions of a prosumer corresponding to a community microgrid of any size. Moreover, it includes appropriate sub-models for prosumer production and consumption prediction. Experimental simulations verify the effectiveness of our approach; and show that our exact value iteration solution matches that of a state-of-the-art method for stochastic planning in very large environments, while outperforming it in terms of computation time.",AAMAS
Limiting the Influence of Low Quality Information in Community Sensing (Page 873),2016,"We consider a community of private sensors that collect measurements of a physical phenomenon, such as air pollution, and report it to a center. The center should be able to prevent low quality reports from degrading the quality of the aggregated information, as there are numerous reasons for operators to inject false sensor data. Hence, it is necessary to track the quality of the sensors over time in order to filter out low quality and malicious reports. To achieve this, we construct a reputation system with a guaranteed bounds on negative impact that malicious sensors can cause, and we evaluate its performance on a realistic dataset.",AAMAS
A Crowdfunding Model for Green Energy Investment,2015,"This paper studies a new renewable energy investment model through crowdfunding, which is motivated by emerging community solar farms. In this paper we develop a sequential game theory model to capture the interactions among crowdfunders, the solar farm owner, and an electricity company who purchases renewable energy generated by the solar farm in a multi-period framework. By characterizing a unique subgame-perfect equilibrium, andcomparing it with a benchmark model without crowdfunding, we find that under crowdfunding although the farm owner reduces its investment level, the overall green energy investment level is increased due to the contribution of crowdfunders. We also find that crowdfunding can increase the penetration of green energy in consumption and thus reduce the energy procurement cost of the electricity company. Finally, the numerical results based on real data indicates crowdfunding is a simple but effective way to boost green generation.",IJCAI
The Case for Community Health Innovation Networks (NOTE),2018,"This commentary1 outlines the rationale for building community health innovation networks in settings of poverty and high burdens of disease. These networks integrate deep research expertise and sustained implementation infrastructure, with the aim of streamlining the design, building and scale up of evidence-based technical innovations for community health. Drawing on our experiences establishing such networks in Mali and Kenya, we discuss the importance of: 1) sustaining operational capacity to strengthen health systems; 2) being strategic about how we embed design research within ongoing implementation efforts; and 3) institutional partnerships that invest in infrastructure to support a series of studies and innovation efforts over time. Without claiming to offer any 'quick and easy' solutions, we argue that this approach has real potential to address the gap between research and practice in technical innovation for global health and sustainable development.",COMPASS
A Centralized Multi-Agent Negotiation Approach to Collaborative Air Traffic Resource Management Planning,2010,"Demand and capacity imbalances in the US national airspace are resolved using traffic management initiatives designed, in current operations, with little collaboration with the airspace users. NASA and its partners have developed a new collaborative concept of operations that requires the users and airspace service provider to work together to choose initiatives that better satisfy the business needs of the users while also ensuring safety to the same standard as today. In this paper, we describe an approach to implementing this concept through a software negotiation framework underpinned by technology developed in the artificial intelligence community. We describe our exploration of peer-to-peer negotiation and how the number of conversation threads and the time sensitivity of offer acceptance led us to a centralized approach. The centralized approach uses hill climbing to evaluate airport slot allocations from a user perspective and a linear programming solver to seek solutions compatible across the user community. Our experiments with full sized problems identify the potential operational benefits as well as limitations, and where future research needs to be focused.",AAAI
Real Estate Ranking via Mixed Land-use Latent Models,2015,"Mixed land use refers to the effort of putting residential, commercial and recreational uses in close proximity to one another. This can contribute economic benefits, support viable public transit, and enhance the perceived security of an area. It is naturally promising to investigate how to rank real estate from the viewpoint of diverse mixed land use, which can be reflected by the portfolio of community functions in the observed area. To that end, in this paper, we develop a geographical function ranking method, named FuncDivRank, by incorporating the functional diversity of communities into real estate appraisal. Specifically, we first design a geographic function learning model to jointly capture the correlations among estate neighborhoods, urban functions, temporal effects, and user mobility patterns. In this way we can learn latent community functions and the corresponding portfolios of estates from human mobility data and Point of Interest (POI) data. Then, we learn the estate ranking indicator by simultaneously maximizing ranking consistency and functional diversity, in a unified probabilistic optimization framework. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation with real-world data. The experimental results demonstrate the enhanced performance of the proposed method for real estate appraisal.",KDD
CSWA: Aggregation-Free Spatial-Temporal Community Sensing,2018,"In this paper, we present a novel community sensing paradigm CSWA Ã¢â¬âCommunity Sensing Without Sensor/Location Data Aggregation. CSWA is designed to obtain the environment information (e.g., air pollution or temperature) in each subarea of the target area, without aggregating sensor and location data collected by community members. CSWA operates on top of a secured peer-to-peer network over the community members and proposes a novel Decentralized Spatial-Temporal Compressive Sensing framework based on Parallelized Stochastic Gradient Descent. Through learning the low-rank structure via distributed optimization, CSWA approximates the value of the sensor data in each subarea (both covered and uncovered) for each sensing cycle using the sensor data locally stored in each memberÃ¢â¬â¢s mobile device. Simulation experiments based on real-world datasets demonstrate that CSWA exhibits low approximation error (i.e., less than 0.2 centi-degree in city-wide temperature sensing task and 10 units of PM2.5 index in urban air pollution sensing) and performs comparably to (sometimes better than) state-of-the-art algorithms based on the data aggregation and centralized computation.",AAAI
LightNet: A Dual Spatiotemporal Encoder Network Model for Lightning Prediction,2019,"Lightning as a natural phenomenon poses serious threats to human life, aviation and electrical infrastructures. Lightning prediction plays a vital role in lightning disaster reduction. Existing prediction methods, usually based on numerical weather models, rely on lightning parameterization schemes for forecasting. These methods, however, have two drawbacks. Firstly, simulations of the numerical weather models usually have deviations in space and time domains, which introduces irreparable biases to subsequent parameterization processes. Secondly, the lightning parameterization schemes are designed manually by experts in meteorology, which means these schemes can hardly benefit from abundant historical data. In this work, we propose a data-driven model based on neural networks, referred to as LightNet, for lightning prediction. Unlike the conventional prediction methods which are fully based on numerical weather models, LightNet introduces recent lightning observations in an attempt to calibrate the simulations and assist the prediction. LightNet first extracts spatiotemporal features of the simulations and observations via dual encoders. These features are then combined by a fusion module. Finally, the fused features are fed into a spatiotemporal decoder to make forecasts. We conduct experimental evaluations on a real-world North China lightning dataset, which shows that LightNet achieves a threefold improvement in equitable threat score for six-hour prediction compared with three established forecast methods.",KDD
Geographical Hidden Markov Tree for Flood Extent Mapping,2018,"Flood extent mapping plays a crucial role in disaster management and national water forecasting. Unfortunately, traditional classification methods are often hampered by the existence of noise, obstacles and heterogeneity in spectral features as well as implicit anisotropic spatial dependency across class labels. In this paper, we propose geographical hidden Markov tree, a probabilistic graphical model that generalizes the common hidden Markov model from a one dimensional sequence to a two dimensional map. Partial order class dependency is incorporated in the hidden class layer with a reverse tree structure. We also investigate computational algorithms for reverse tree construction, model parameter learning and class inference. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real world datasets show that proposed model outperforms multiple baselines in flood mapping, and our algorithms are scalable on large data sizes.",KDD
Utilizing Text Mining on Online Medical Forums to Predict Label Change due to Adverse Drug Reactions,2015,"We present an end-to-end text mining methodology for relation extraction of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from medical forums on the Web. Our methodology is novel in that it combines three major characteristics: (i) an underlying concept of using a head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG) based parser; (ii) domain-specific relation patterns, the acquisition of which is done primarily using unsupervised methods applied to a large, unlabeled text corpus; and (iii) automated post-processing algorithms for enhancing the set of extracted relations. We empirically demonstrate the ability of our proposed approach to predict ADRs prior to their reporting by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Put differently, we put our approach to a predictive test by demonstrating that our methodology can credibly point to ADRs that were not uncovered in clinical trials for evaluating new drugs that come to market but were only reported later on by the FDA as a label change.",KDD
PerDREP: Personalized Drug Effectiveness Prediction from Longitudinal Observational Data,2019,"In contrast to the one-size-fits-all approach to medicine, precision medicine will allow targeted prescriptions based on the specific profile of the patient thereby avoiding adverse reactions and ineffective but expensive treatments. Longitudinal observational data such as Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have become an emerging data source for personalized medicine. In this paper, we propose a unified computational framework, called PerDREP, to predict the unique response patterns of each individual patient from EHR data. PerDREP models individual responses of each patient to the drug exposure by introducing a linear system to account for patients' heterogeneity, and incorporates a patient similarity graph as a network regularization. We formulate PerDREP as a convex optimization problem and develop an iterative gradient descent method to solve it. In the experiments, we identify the effect of drugs on Glycated hemoglobin test results. The experimental results provide evidence that the proposed method is not only more accurate than state-of-the-art methods, but is also able to automatically cluster patients into multiple coherent groups, thus paving the way for personalized medicine.",KDD
Predictive Approaches for Low-Cost Preventive Medicine Program in Developing Countries,2015,"Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are no longer just a problem for high-income countries, but they are also a problem that affects developing countries. Preventive medicine is definitely the key to combat NCDs; however, the cost of preventive programs is a critical issue affecting the popularization of these medicine programs in developing countries. In this study, we investigate predictive modeling for providing a low-cost preventive medicine program. In our two-year-long field study in Bangladesh, we collected the health checkup results of 15,075 subjects, the data of 6,607 prescriptions, and the follow-up examination results of 2,109 subjects. We address three prediction problems, namely subject risk prediction, drug recommendation, and future risk prediction, by using machine learning techniques; our multiple-classifier approach successfully reduced the costs of health checkups, a multi-task learning method provided accurate recommendation for specific types of drugs, and an active learning method achieved an efficient assignment of healthcare workers for the follow-up care of subjects.",KDD
Interpretable Drug Target Prediction Using Deep Neural Representation,2018,"The identification of drug-target interactions (DTIs) is a key task in drug discovery, where drugs are chemical compounds and targets are proteins.Ã Traditional DTI prediction methods are either time consuming (simulation-based methods) or heavily dependent on domain expertise (similarity-based and feature-based methods). In this work, we propose an end-to-end neural network model that predicts DTIs directly from low level representations.Ã In addition to making predictions, our model provides biological interpretation using two-way attention mechanism. Instead of using simplified settings where a dataset is evaluated as a whole, we designed an evaluation dataset from BindingDB following more realistic settings where predictions of unobserved examples (proteins and drugs) have to be made.Ã We experimentally compared our model with matrix factorization, similarity-based methods, and a previous deep learning approach.Ã Overall, the results show that our model outperforms other approaches without requiring domain knowledge and feature engineering.Ã In a case study, we illustrated the ability of our approach to provide biological insights to interpret the predictions.",IJCAI
MVAN: Multi-view Attention Networks for Real Money Trading Detection in Online Games,2019,"Online gaming is a multi-billion dollar industry that entertains a large, global population. However, one unfortunate phenomenon known as real money trading harms the competition and the fun. Real money trading is an interesting economic activity used to exchange assets in a virtual world with real world currencies, leading to imbalance of game economy and inequality of wealth and opportunity. Game operation teams have been devoting much efforts on real money trading detection, however, it still remains a challenging task. To overcome the limitation from traditional methods conducted by game operation teams, we propose, MVAN, the first multi-view attention networks for detecting real money trading with multi-view data sources. We present a multi-graph attention network (MGAT) in the graph structure view, a behavior attention network (BAN) in the vertex content view, a portrait attention network (PAN) in the vertex attribute view and a data source attention network (DSAN) in the data source view. Experiments conducted on real-world game logs from a commercial NetEase MMORPG( JusticePC) show that our method consistently performs promising results compared with other competitive methods over time and verifiy the importance and rationality of attention mechanisms. MVAN is deployed to several MMORPGs in NetEase in practice and achieving remarkable performance improvement and acceleration. Our method can easily generalize to other types of related tasks in real world, such as fraud detection, drug tracking and money laundering tracking etc.",KDD
Active search on graphs,2013,"Active search is an increasingly important learning problem in which we use a limited budget of label queries to discover as many members of a certain class as possible. Numerous real-world applications may be approached in this manner, including fraud detection, product recommendation, and drug discovery. Active search has model learning and exploration/exploitation features similar to those encountered in active learning and bandit problems, but algorithms for those problems do not fit active search.
 Previous work on the active search problem [5] showed that the optimal algorithm requires a lookahead evaluation of expected utility that is exponential in the number of selections to be made and proposed a truncated lookahead heuristic. Inspired by the success of myopic methods for active learning and bandit problems, we propose a myopic method for active search on graphs. We suggest selecting points by maximizing a score considering the potential impact of selecting a node, meant to emulate lookahead while avoiding exponential search. We test the proposed algorithm empirically on real-world graphs and show that it outperforms popular approaches for active learning and bandit problems as well as truncated lookahead of a few steps.",KDD

Learning the Joint Representation of Heterogeneous Temporal Events for Clinical Endpoint Prediction,2018,"The availability of a large amount of electronic health records (EHR) provides huge opportunities to improve health care service by mining these data. One important application is clinical endpoint prediction, which aims to predict whether a disease, a symptom or an abnormal lab test will happen in the future according to patients' history records. This paper develops deep learning techniques for clinical endpoint prediction, which are effective in many practical applications. However, the problem is very challenging since patients' history records contain multiple heterogeneous temporal events such as lab tests, diagnosis, and drug administrations. The visiting patterns of different types of events vary significantly, and there exist complex nonlinear relationships between different events. In this paper, we propose a novel model for learning the joint representation of heterogeneous temporal events. The model adds a new gate to control the visiting rates of different events which effectively models the irregular patterns of different events and their nonlinear correlations. Experiment results with real-world clinical data on the tasks of predicting death and abnormal lab tests prove the effectiveness of our proposed approach over competitive baselines.",AAAI
Dual Memory Neural Computer for Asynchronous Two-view Sequential Learning,2018,"One of the core tasks in multi-view learning is to capture relations among views. For sequential data, the relations not only span across views, but also extend throughout the view length to form long-term intra-view and inter-view interactions. In this paper, we present a new memory augmented neural network that aims to model these complex interactions between two asynchronous sequential views. Our model uses two encoders for reading from and writing to two external memories for encoding input views. The intra-view interactions and the long-term dependencies are captured by the use of memories during this encoding process. There are two modes of memory accessing in our system: late-fusion and early-fusion, corresponding to late and early inter-view interactions. In the late-fusion mode, the two memories are separated, containing only view-specific contents. In the early-fusion mode, the two memories share the same addressing space, allowing cross-memory accessing. In both cases, the knowledge from the memories will be combined by a decoder to make predictions over the output space. The resulting dual memory neural computer is demonstrated on a comprehensive set of experiments, including a synthetic task of summing two sequences and the tasks of drug prescription and disease progression in healthcare. The results demonstrate competitive performance over both traditional algorithms and deep learning methods designed for multi-view problems.",KDD
Predicting Future Scientific Discoveries Based on a Networked Analysis of the Past Literature,2015,"We present KnIT, the Knowledge Integration Toolkit, a system for accelerating scientific discovery and predicting previously unknown protein-protein interactions. Such predictions enrich biological research and are pertinent to drug discovery and the understanding of disease. Unlike a prior study, KnIT is now fully automated and demonstrably scalable. It extracts information from the scientific literature, automatically identifying direct and indirect references to protein interactions, which is knowledge that can be represented in network form. It then reasons over this network with techniques such as matrix factorization and graph diffusion to predict new, previously unknown interactions. The accuracy and scope of KnIT's knowledge extractions are validated using comparisons to structured, manually curated data sources as well as by performing retrospective studies that predict subsequent literature discoveries using literature available prior to a given date. The KnIT methodology is a step towards automated hypothesis generation from text, with potential application to other scientific domains.",KDD
Pharmacovigilance via Baseline Regularization with Large-Scale Longitudinal Observational Data,2017,"Several prominent public health incidents that occurred at the beginning of this century due to adverse drug events (ADEs) have raised international awareness of governments and industries about pharmacovigilance (PhV), the science and activities to monitor and prevent adverse events caused by pharmaceutical products after they are introduced to the market. A major data source for PhV is large-scale longitudinal observational databases (LODs) such as electronic health records (EHRs) and medical insurance claim databases. Inspired by the Multiple Self-Controlled Case Series (MSCCS) model, arguably the leading method for ADE discovery from LODs, we propose baseline regularization, a regularized generalized linear model that leverages the diverse health profiles available in LODs across different individuals at different times. We apply the proposed method as well as MSCCS to the Marshfield Clinic EHR. Experimental results suggest that incorporating the heterogeneity among different patients and different times help to improve the performance in identifying benchmark ADEs from the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership ground truth",KDD
FSM: A Fast Similarity Measurement for Gene Regulatory Networks via Genes' Influence Power,2019,"The problem of graph similarity measurement is fundamental in both complex networks and bioinformatics researches. Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) describe the interactions between the molecules in organisms, and are widely studied in the fields of medical AI. By measuring the similarity between GRNs, significant information can be obtained to assist the applications like gene functions prediction, drug development and medical diagnosis. Most of the existing similarity measurements have been focusing on the graph isomorphisms and are usually NP-hard problems. Thus, they are not suitable for applications in biology and clinical research due to the complexity and large-scale features of real-world GRNs. In this paper, a fast similarity measurement method called FSM for GRNs is proposed. Unlike the conventional measurements, it pays more attention to the differences between those influential genes. For the convenience and reliability, a new index defined as influence power is adopted to describe the influential genes which have greater position in a GRN. FSM was applied in nine datasets of various scales and is compared with state-of-art methods. The results demonstrated that it ran significantly faster than other methods without sacrificing measurement performance.",IJCAI
Case-Based Meta-Prediction for Bioinformatics,2013,"Before laboratory testing, bioinformatics problems often require a machine-learned predictor to identify the most likely choices among a wealth of possibilities. Researchers may advocate different predictors for the same problem, none of which is best in all situations. This paper introduces a case-based meta-predictor that combines a set of elaborate, pre-existing predictors to improve their accuracy on a difficult and important problem: protein-ligand docking. The method focuses on the reliability of its component predictors, and has broad potential applications in biology and chemistry. Despite noisy and biased input, the method outperforms its individual components on benchmark data. It provides a promising solution for the performance improvement of compound virtual screening, which would thereby reduce the time and cost of drug discovery.",AAAI
Estimating Cellular Goals from High-Dimensional Biological Data,2019,"Optimization-based models have been used to predict cellular behavior for over 25 years. The constraints in these models are derived from genome annotations, measured macromolecular composition of cells, and by measuring the cell's growth rate and metabolism in different conditions. The cellular goal (the optimization problem that the cell is trying to solve) can be challenging to derive experimentally for many organisms, including human or mammalian cells, which have complex metabolic capabilities and are not well understood. Existing approaches to learning goals from data include (a) estimating a linear objective function, or (b) estimating linear constraints that model complex biochemical reactions and constrain the cell's operation. The latter approach is important because often the known reactions are not enough to explain observations; therefore, there is a need to extend automatically the model complexity by learning new reactions. However, this leads to nonconvex optimization problems, and existing tools cannot scale to realistically large metabolic models. Hence, constraint estimation is still used sparingly despite its benefits for modeling cell metabolism, which is important for developing novel antimicrobials against pathogens, discovering cancer drug targets, and producing value-added chemicals. Here, we develop the first approach to estimating constraint reactions from data that can scale to realistically large metabolic models. Previous tools were used on problems having less than 75 reactions and 60 metabolites, which limits real-life-size applications. We perform extensive experiments using 75 large-scale metabolic network models for different organisms (including bacteria, yeasts, and mammals) and show that our algorithm can recover cellular constraint reactions. The recovered constraints enable accurate prediction of metabolic states in hundreds of growth environments not seen in training data, and we recover useful cellular goals even when some measurements are missing.",KDD
SVMpAUCtight: a new support vector method for optimizing partial AUC based on a tight convex upper bound,2013,"The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a well known performance measure in machine learning and data mining. In an increasing number of applications, however, ranging from ranking applications to a variety of important bioinformatics applications, performance is measured in terms of the partial area under the ROC curve between two specified false positive rates. In recent work, we proposed a structural SVM based approach for optimizing this performance measure (Narasimhan and Agarwal, 2013). In this paper, we develop a new support vector method, SVMpAUCtight, that optimizes a tighter convex upper bound on the partial AUC loss, which leads to both improved accuracy and reduced computational complexity. In particular, by rewriting the empirical partial AUC risk as a maximum over subsets of negative instances, we derive a new formulation, where a modified form of the earlier optimization objective is evaluated on each of these subsets, leading to a tighter hinge relaxation on the partial AUC loss. As with our previous method, the resulting optimization problem can be solved using a cutting-plane algorithm, but the new method has better run time guarantees. We also discuss a projected subgradient method for solving this problem, which offers additional computational savings in certain settings. We demonstrate on a wide variety of bioinformatics tasks, ranging from protein-protein interaction prediction to drug discovery tasks, that the proposed method does, in many cases, perform significantly better on the partial AUC measure than the previous structural SVM approach. In addition, we also develop extensions of our method to learn sparse and group sparse models, often of interest in biological applications.",KDD
Succinct interval-splitting tree for scalable similarity search of compound-protein pairs with property constraints,2013,"Analyzing functional interactions between small compounds and proteins is indispensable in genomic drug discovery. Since rich information on various compound-protein inter- actions is available in recent molecular databases, strong demands for making best use of such databases require to in- vent powerful methods to help us find new functional compound-protein pairs on a large scale. We present the succinct interval-splitting tree algorithm (SITA) that efficiently per- forms similarity search in databases for compound-protein pairs with respect to both binary fingerprints and real-valued properties. SITA achieves both time and space efficiency by developing the data structure called interval-splitting trees, which enables to efficiently prune the useless portions of search space, and by incorporating the ideas behind wavelet tree, a succinct data structure to compactly represent trees. We experimentally test SITA on the ability to retrieve similar compound-protein pairs/substrate-product pairs for a query from large databases with over 200 million compound- protein pairs/substrate-product pairs and show that SITA performs better than other possible approaches.",KDD
MARAS: Signaling Multi-Drug Adverse Reactions,2017,"There is a growing need for computing-supported methods that facilitate the automated signaling of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) otherwise left undiscovered from the exploding amount of ADR reports filed by patients, medical professionals and drug manufacturers. In this research, we design a Multi-Drug Adverse Reaction Analytics Strategy, called MARAS, to signal severe unknown ADRs triggered by the usage of a combination of drugs, also known as Multi-Drug Adverse Reactions (MDAR). First, MARAS features an efficient signal generation algorithm based on association rule learning that extracts non-spurious MDAR associations. Second, MARAS incorporates contextual information to detect drug combinations that are strongly associated with a set of ADRs. It groups related associations into Contextual Association Clusters (CACs) that then avail contextual information to evaluate the significance of the discovered MDAR Associations. Lastly, we use this contextual significance to rank discoveries by their notion of interestingness to signal the most compelling MDARs. To demonstrate the utility of MARAS, it is compared with state-of-the-art techniques and evaluated via case studies on datasets collected by U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).",KDD
Unsupervised Discovery of Drug Side-Effects from Heterogeneous Data Sources,2017,"Drug side-effects become a worldwide public health concern, which are the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. Pharmaceutical industry has paid tremendous effort to identify drug side-effects during the drug development. However, it is impossible and impractical to identify all of them. Fortunately, drug side-effects can also be reported on heterogeneous platforms (i.e., data sources), such as FDA Adverse Event Reporting System and various online communities. However, existing supervised and semi-supervised approaches are not practical as annotating labels are expensive in the medical field. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective unsupervised model Sifter to automatically discover drug side-effects. Sifter enhances the estimation on drug side-effects by learning from various online platforms and measuring platform-level and user-level quality simultaneously. In this way, Sifter demonstrates better performance compared with existing approaches in terms of correctly identifying drug side-effects. Experimental results on five real-world datasets show that Sifter can significantly improve the performance of identifying side-effects compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.",KDD
Drug Similarity Integration Through Attentive Multi-view Graph Auto-Encoders,2018,"Drug similarity has been studied to support downstream clinical tasks such as inferring novel properties of drugs (e.g. side effects, indications, interactions) from known properties. The growing availability of new types of drug features brings the opportunity of learning a more comprehensive and accurate drug similarity that represents the full spectrum of underlying drug relations. However, it is challenging to integrate these heterogeneous, noisy, nonlinear-relatedÃ information to learn accurate similarity measures especially when labels are scarce. Moreover, there is a trade-off between accuracy and interpretability. In this paper, we propose to learn accurate and interpretable similarity measures from multiple types of drug features. In particular, we model the integration using multi-view graph auto-encoders, and add attentive mechanism to determine the weights for each view with respect to corresponding tasks and features for better interpretability. Our model has flexible design for both semi-supervised and unsupervised settings. Experimental results demonstrated significant predictive accuracy improvement. Case studies also showed better model capacity (e.g. embed node features) and interpretability.",IJCAI
Multitask Dyadic Prediction and Its Application in Prediction of Adverse Drug-Drug Interaction,2017,"Adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs) remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality around the world. Identifying potential DDIs during the drug design process is critical in guiding targeted clinical drug safety testing. Although detection of adverse DDIs is conducted during Phase IV clinical trials, there are still a large number of new DDIs founded by accidents after the drugs were put on market. With the arrival of big data era, more and more pharmaceutical research and development data are becoming available, which provides an invaluable resource for digging insights that can potentially be leveraged in early prediction of DDIs. Many computational approaches have been proposed in recent years for DDI prediction. However, most of them focused on binary prediction (with or without DDI), despite the fact that each DDI is associated with a different type. Predicting the actual DDI type will help us better understand the DDI mechanism and identify proper ways to prevent it. In this paper, we formulate the DDI type prediction problem as a multitask dyadic regression problem, where the prediction of each specific DDI type is treated as a task. Compared with conventional matrix completion approaches which can only impute the missing entries in the DDI matrix, our approach can directly regress those dyadic relationships (DDIs) and thus can be extend to new drugs more easily. We developed an effective proximal gradient method to solve the problem. Evaluation on real world datasets is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",AAAI
Computational Drug Repositioning Using Continuous Self-Controlled Case Series,2016,"Computational Drug Repositioning (CDR) is the task of discovering potential new indications for existing drugs by mining large-scale heterogeneous drug-related data sources. Leveraging the patient-level temporal ordering information between numeric physiological measurements and various drug prescriptions provided in Electronic Health Records (EHRs), we propose a Continuous Self-controlled Case Series (CSCCS) model for CDR. As an initial evaluation, we look for drugs that can control Fasting Blood Glucose (FBG) level in our experiments. Applying CSCCS to the Marshfield Clinic EHR, well-known drugs that are indicated for controlling blood glucose level are rediscovered. Furthermore, some drugs with recent literature support for the potential effect of blood glucose level control are also identified.",KDD
Medicine in the age of electronic health records,2014,"In the era of EHRs, it is possible to examine the outcomes of decisions made by doctors during clinical practice to identify patterns of care---generating evidence based on the collective practice of experts. We will discuss methods that use unstructured patient data to monitor for adverse drug events, profile specific drugs, identify off-label drug usage, uncover 'natural experiments' and generate practice-based evidence for difficult-to-test clinical hypotheses. We will describe how to detect associations among drugs and their adverse events several years before an alert is issued as well as compute the true rate of drug-drug interactions. We will present approaches to identify novel off-label uses of drugs using the patient feature matrix along with prior knowledge about drugs, diseases, and known usage. We will review a natural experiment--where a subset of congestive heart failure patients who were prescribed Cilostazol despite its black box warning--and profile its safety. We will discuss the testing of a clinical hypothesis about an association between allergic conditions and chronic uveitis in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis.",KDD
Baseline Regularization for Computational Drug Repositioning with Longitudinal Observational Data,2016,"Computational Drug Repositioning (CDR) is the knowledge discovery process of finding new indications for existing drugs leveraging heterogeneous drug-related data. Longitudinal observational data such as Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have become an emerging data source for CDR. To address the high-dimensional, irregular, subject and time-heterogeneous nature of EHRs, we propose Baseline Regularization (BR) and a variant that extend the one-way fixed effect model, which is a standard approach to analyze small-scale longitudinal data. For evaluation, we use the proposed methods to search for drugs that can lower Fasting Blood Glucose (FBG) level in the Marshfield Clinic EHR. Experimental results suggest that the proposed methods are capable of rediscovering drugs that can lower FBG level as well as identifying some potential blood sugar lowering drugs in the literature.",IJCAI
Naranjo Question Answering using End-to-End Multi-task Learning Model,2019,"In the clinical domain, it is important to understand whether an adverse drug reaction (ADR) is caused by a particular medication. Clinical judgement studies help judge the causal relation between a medication and its ADRs. In this study, we present the first attempt to automatically infer the causality between a drug and an ADR from electronic health records (EHRs) by answering the Naranjo questionnaire, the validated clinical question answering set used by domain experts for ADR causality assessment. Using physicians' annotation as the gold standard, our proposed joint model, which uses multi-task learning to predict the answers of a subset of the Naranjo questionnaire, significantly outperforms the baseline pipeline model with a good margin, achieving a macro-weighted f-score between 0.3652-0.5271 and micro-weighted f-score between 0.9523-0.9918.",KDD
Adverse Drug Reaction Prediction with Symbolic Latent Dirichlet Allocation,2017,"Adverse drug reaction (ADR) is a major burden for patients and healthcare industry. It usually causes preventable hospitalizations and deaths, while associated with a huge amount of cost. Traditional preclinical in vitro safety profiling and clinical safety trials are restricted in terms of small scale, long duration, huge financial costs and limited statistical signifi- cance. The availability of large amounts of drug and ADR data potentially allows ADR predictions during the drugsâ early preclinical stage with data analytics methods to inform more targeted clinical safety tests. Despite their initial success, existing methods have trade-offs among interpretability, predictive power and efficiency. This urges us to explore methods that could have all these strengths and provide practical solutions for real world ADR predictions. We cast the ADR-drug relation structure into a three-layer hierarchical Bayesian model. We interpret each ADR as a symbolic word and apply latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to learn topics that may represent certain biochemical mechanism that relates ADRs with drug structures. Based on LDA, we designed an equivalent regularization term to incorporate the hierarchical ADR domain knowledge. Finally, we developed a mixed input model leveraging a fast collapsed Gibbs sampling method that the complexity of each iteration of Gibbs sampling proportional only to the number of positive ADRs. Experiments on real world data show our models achieved higher prediction accuracy and shorter running time than the state-of-the-art alternatives.",AAAI
Empirical bayes model to combine signals of adverse drug reactions,2013,"Data mining is a crucial tool for identifying risk signals of potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs). However, mining of ADR signals is currently limited to leveraging a single data source at a time. It is widely believed that combining ADR evidence from multiple data sources will result in a more accurate risk identification system. We present a methodology based on empirical Bayes modeling to combine ADR signals mined from ~5 million adverse event reports collected by the FDA, and healthcare data corresponding to 46 million patients' the main two types of information sources currently employed for signal detection. Based on four sets of test cases (gold standard), we demonstrate that our method leads to a statistically significant and substantial improvement in signal detection accuracy, averaging 40% over the use of each source independently, and an area under the ROC curve of 0.87. We also compare the method with alternative supervised learning approaches, and argue that our approach is preferable as it does not require labeled (training) samples whose availability is currently limited. To our knowledge, this is the first effort to combine signals from these two complementary data sources, and to demonstrate the benefits of a computationally integrative strategy for drug safety surveillance.",KDD
LEAP: Learning to Prescribe Effective and Safe Treatment Combinations for Multimorbidity,2017,"Managing patients with complex multimorbidity has long been recognized as a difficult problem due to complex disease and medication dependencies and the potential risk of adverse drug interactions. Existing work either uses complicated rule-based protocols which are hard to implement and maintain, or simple statistical models that treat each disease independently, which may lead to sub-optimal or even harmful drug combinations. In this work, we propose the LEAP (LEArn to Prescribe) algorithm to decompose the treatment recommendation into a sequential decision-making process while automatically determining the appropriate number of medications. A recurrent decoder is used to model label dependencies and content-based attention is used to capture label instance mapping. We further leverage reinforcement learning to fine tune the model parameters to ensure accuracy and completeness. We incorporate external clinical knowledge into the design of the reinforcement reward to effectively prevent generating unfavorable drug combinations. Both quantitative experiments and qualitative case studies are conducted on two real world electronic health record datasets to verify the effectiveness of our solution. On both datasets, LEAP significantly outperforms baselines by up to 10-30% in terms of mean Jaccard coefficient and removes 99.8% adverse drug interactions in the recommended treatment sets.",KDD
Accelerating Prototype-Based Drug Discovery using Conditional Diversity Networks,2018,"Designing a new drug is a lengthy and expensive process. As the space of potential molecules is very large (10 23 - 10 60 ), a common technique during drug discovery is to start from a molecule which already has some of the desired properties. An interdisciplinary team of scientists generates hypothesis about the required changes to the prototype. In this work, we develop an algorithmic unsupervised-approach that automatically generates potential drug molecules given a prototype drug. We show that the molecules generated by the system are valid molecules and significantly different from the prototype drug. Out of the compounds generated by the system, we identified 35 FDA-approved drugs. As an example, our system generated Isoniazid - one of the main drugs for Tuberculosis. The system is currently being deployed for use in collaboration with pharmaceutical companies to further analyze the additional generated molecules.",KDD
A Multi-Agent Platform for Automating the Collection of Patient-Provided Clinical Feedback (Page 831),2015,"Clinical outcome measures are well-established quantitative assessments of medical treatment that are crucial for understanding the effectiveness of prescribed drugs. However, recent studies suggest that timely and long-term clinical outcome measures are not usually found in the patient records. The study attributes the lack of quantitative follow-up to the reluctance of the clinicians treating the patients, whose active schedules incline them to use (insufficient) brief descriptions of the cases, greatly reducing the quality of care. To ease the clinicians burden and improve the process of patient follow-up while simultaneously dealing with the complexity of our domain, we designed and deployed a multi-agent platform to automate the process of collecting patient-provided clinical outcome measures without clinicians intervention. The system also acts as a mediator between patients and scientists, by seeking patient consent to incorporate anonymised versions of the collected data into scientific studies to which the patients are found eligible. This paper presents the design, prototype and deployment results of our system, highlighting foreseen clinical merits and documenting challenges faced throughout our experience.",AAMAS
Assessing the Predictability of Hospital Readmission Using Machine Learning,2013,"Unplanned hospital readmissions raise health care costsand cause significant distress to patients. Hence, predictingwhich patients are at risk to be readmitted isof great interest. In this paper, we mine large amountsof administrative information from claim data, includingpatients demographics, dispensed drugs, medical orsurgical procedures performed, and medical diagnosis,in order to predict readmission using supervised learningmethods. Our objective is to gain knowledge aboutthe predictive power of the available information. Ourpreliminary results on data from the provincial hospitalsystem in Quebec illustrate the potential for this approachto reveal important information on factors thattrigger hospital readmission. Our findings suggest thata substantial portion of readmissions is inherently hardto predict. Consequently, the use of the raw readmissionrate as an indicator of the quality of provided care mightnot be appropriate.",AAAI
Collaborative matrix factorization with multiple similarities for predicting drug-target interactions,2013,"We address the problem of predicting new drug-target interactions from three inputs: known interactions, similarities over drugs and those over targets. This setting has been considered by many methods, which however have a common problem of allowing to have only one similarity matrix over drugs and that over targets. The key idea of our approach is to use more than one similarity matrices over drugs as well as those over targets, where weights over the multiple similarity matrices are estimated from data to automatically select similarities, which are effective for improving the performance of predicting drug-target interactions. We propose a factor model, named Multiple Similarities Collaborative Matrix Factorization(MSCMF), which projects drugs and targets into a common low-rank feature space, which is further consistent with weighted similarity matrices over drugs and those over targets. These two low-rank matrices and weights over similarity matrices are estimated by an alternating least squares algorithm. Our approach allows to predict drug-target interactions by the two low-rank matrices collaboratively and to detect similarities which are important for predicting drug-target interactions. This approach is general and applicable to any binary relations with similarities over elements, being found in many applications, such as recommender systems. In fact, MSCMF is an extension of weighted low-rank approximation for one-class collaborative filtering. We extensively evaluated the performance of MSCMF by using both synthetic and real datasets. Experimental results showed nice properties of MSCMF on selecting similarities useful in improving the predictive performance and the performance advantage of MSCMF over six state-of-the-art methods for predicting drug-target interactions.",KDD
Early Prediction of Cardiac Arrest (Code Blue) using Electronic Medical Records,2015,"Code Blue is an emergency code used in hospitals to indicate when a patient goes into cardiac arrest and needs resuscitation. When Code Blue is called, an on-call medical team staffed by physicians and nurses is paged and rushes in to try to save the patient's life. It is an intense, chaotic, and resource-intensive process, and despite the considerable effort, survival rates are still less than 20% [4]. Research indicates that patients actually start showing clinical signs of deterioration some time before going into cardiac arrest [1][2[][3], making early prediction, and possibly intervention, feasible. In this paper, we describe our work, in partnership with NorthShore University HealthSystem, that preemptively flags patients who are likely to go into cardiac arrest, using signals extracted from demographic information, hospitalization history, vitals and laboratory measurements in patient-level electronic medical records. We find that early prediction of Code Blue is possible and when compared with state of the art existing method used by hospitals (MEWS - Modified Early Warning Score)[4], our methods perform significantly better. Based on these results, this system is now being considered for deployment in hospital settings.",KDD
Adaptable Regression Method for Ensemble Consensus Forecasting,2016,"Accurate weather forecasts enhance sustainability by facilitating decision making across a broad range of endeavors including public safety, transportation, energy generation and management, retail logistics, emergency preparedness, and many others. This paper presents a method for combining multiple scalar forecasts to obtain deterministic predictions that are generally more accurate than any of the constituents. Exponentially-weighted forecast bias estimates and error covariance matrices are formed at observation sites, aggregated spatially and temporally, and used to formulate a constrained, regularized least squares regression problem that may be solved using quadratic programming. The model is re-trained when new observations arrive, updating the forecast bias estimates and consensus combination weights to adapt to weather regime and input forecast model changes. The algorithm is illustrated for 0-72 hour temperature forecasts at over 1200 sites in the contiguous U.S. based on a 22-member forecast ensemble, and its performance over multiple seasons is compared to a state-of-the-art ensemble-based forecasting system. In addition to weather forecasts, this approach to consensus may be useful for ensemble predictions of climate, wind energy, solar power, energy demand, and numerous other quantities.",AAAI
Evaluating the Interpretability of the Knowledge Compilation Map: Communicating Logical Statements Effectively,2019,"Knowledge compilation techniques translate propositional theories into equivalent forms to increase their computational tractability. But, how should we best present these propositional theories to a human? We analyze the standard taxonomy of propositional theories for relative interpretability across three model domains: highway driving, emergency triage, and the chopsticks game. We generate decision-making agents which produce logical explanations for their actions and apply knowledge compilation to these explanations. Then, we evaluate how quickly, accurately, and confidently users comprehend the generated explanations. We find that domain, formula size, and negated logical connectives significantly affect comprehension while formula properties typically associated with interpretability are not strong predictors of human ability to comprehend the theory.",IJCAI
"Technology, Home Health Care, And Heart Failure: A Qualitative Analysis With Multiple Stakeholders",2019,"Home health aides (HHAs) increasingly being used by adults with heart failure for long-term assistance and post-hospitalization care. Despite being heavily involved in numerous aspects of heart failure management, most HHAs have not received heart failure training. They also struggle to get in touch with supervising nurses or other members of the care team when they have clinical questions, which may result in unnecessary visits to the emergency room. In addition, despite serving as a backbone in the health system for patients, HHAs, who are mostly women and minorities, are a marginalized and vulnerable group of frontline caregivers, enduring erratic employment, low wages, discrimination, and high levels of burnout. Although digital technologies could help to address many of the challenges HHAs face, little is known about the current impact of technology on HHAs work practices. To this end, we conducted a multi-stakeholder qualitative study with 38 participants in New York City using semi-structured interviews and focus groups. We uncover the ways in which technology is used, the complex socio-technical factors that underpin heart failure care, and stakeholder suggestions for how technology could improve HHAs work. Building on these insights, we synthesize design opportunities for researchers and designers interested in developing tools that support the delivery of home health care for patients suffering from life-threatening diseases like heart failure.",COMPASS
Toward personalized care management of patients at risk: the diabetes case study,2011,"Chronic diseases constitute the leading cause of mortality in the western world, have a major impact on the patients' quality of life, and comprise the bulk of healthcare costs. Nowadays, healthcare data management systems integrate large amounts of medical information on patients, including diagnoses, medical procedures, lab test results, and more. Sophisticated analysis methods are needed for utilizing these data to assist in patient management and to enhance treatment quality at reduced costs. In this study, we take a first step towards better disease management of diabetic patients by applying state-of-the art methods to anticipate the patient's future health condition and to identify patients at high risk. Two relevant outcome measures are explored: the need for emergency care services and the probability of the treatment producing a sub-optimal result, as defined by domain experts. By identifying the high-risk patients our prediction system can be used by healthcare providers to prepare both financially and logistically for the patient needs. To demonstrate a potential downstream application for the identified high-risk patients, we explore the association between the physician treating these patients and the treatment outcome, and propose a system that can assist healthcare providers in optimizing the match between a patient and a physician.
 Our work formulates the problem and examines the performance of several learning models on data from several thousands of patients. We further describe a pilot system built on the results of this analysis. We show that the risk for the two considered outcomes can be evaluated from patients' characteristics and that features of the patient-physician match improve the prediction accuracy for the treatment's success. These results suggest that personalized medicine can be valuable for high risk patients and raise interesting questions for future improvements.",KDD
Dynamic and Robust Wildfire Risk Prediction System: An Unsupervised Approach,2016,"Ability to predict the risk of damaging events (e.g. wildfires) is crucial in helping emergency services in their decision making processes, to mitigate and reduce the impact of such events. Today, wildfire rating systems have been in operation extensively in many countries around the world to estimate the danger of wildfires. In this paper we propose a data-driven approach to predict wildfire risk using weather data. We show how we address the inherent challenge arising due to the temporal dynamicity of weather data. Weather observations naturally change in time, with finer-scale variation (e.g. stationary day or night) or large variations (nonstationary day or night), and this determines a temporal variation of the predicted wildfire danger. We show how our dynamic wildfire danger prediction model addresses the aforementioned challenge using context-based anomaly detection techniques. We call our predictive model a Context-Based Fire Risk (CBFR) model. The advantage of our model is that it maintains multiple historical models for different temporal variations (e.g. day versus night), and uses ensemble learning techniques to predict wildfire risk with high accuracy. In addition, it is completely unsupervised and does not rely on expert knowledge, which makes it flexible and easily applied to any region of interest. Our CBFR model is also scalable and can potentially be parallelised to speed up computation. We have considered multiple wildfire locations in the Blue Mountains, Australia as a case study, and compared the results of our system with the existing well-established Australian wildfire rating system. The experimental results show that our predictive model has a substantially higher accuracy in predicting wildfire risk, which makes it an effective model to supplement the operational Australian wildfire rating system.",KDD
Risk Based Optimization for Improving Emergency Medical Systems,2015,"In emergency medical systems, arriving at the incident locationa few seconds early can save a human life. Thus, this paper is motivated by the need to reduce the response timeÃ¢â¬â time taken to arrive at the incident location after receivingthe emergency call Ã¢â¬â of Emergency Response Vehicles, ERVs(ex: ambulances, fire rescue vehicles) for as many requests as possible. We expect to achieve this primarily by positioning the Ã¢â¬ÂrightÃ¢â¬Â number of ERVs at the Ã¢â¬ÂrightÃ¢â¬Â places and at the Ã¢â¬ÂrightÃ¢â¬Â times. Given the exponentially large action space(with respect to number of ERVs and their placement) and the stochasticity in location and timing of emergency incidents,this problem is computationally challenging. To that end, ourcontributions building on existing data-driven approaches are three fold:1. Based on real world evaluation metrics, we provide a riskbased optimization criterion to learn from past incident data. Instead of minimizing expected response time, we minimize the largest value of response time such that the risk of finding requests that have a higher value is bounded(ex: Only 10% of requests should have a response time greater than 8 minutes).2. We develop a mixed integer linear optimization formulation to learn and compute an allocation from a set of inputrequests while considering the risk criterion.3. To allow for Ã¢â¬ÂliveÃ¢â¬Â reallocation of ambulances, we provide a decomposition method based on Lagrangian Relaxation to significantly reduce the run-time of the optimization formulation.Finally, we provide an exhaustive evaluation on real-world datasets from two asian cities that demonstrates the improvement provided by our approach over current practice and the best known approach from literature.",AAAI
Reducing Incarceration through Prioritized Interventions,2018,"The most vulnerable individuals in society often struggle with long-lasting, multi-faceted challenges like mental illness, substance abuse, chronic health conditions, and homelessness. Individuals experiencing these difficulties tend to interact with public services and departments frequently, but many communities are struggling to identify those individuals, let alone meet their needs in meaningful and cost-effective ways. In this paper, we describe our work with Johnson County, Kansas, that uses machine learning to prioritize outreach to individuals most at risk of being booked into jail within the next year. For the first time, we brought together Johnson County's jail, emergency medical, and mental health data, identified individuals who touch multiple systems, and built a model to predict individual jail bookings. Our system significantly outperformed both a random baseline and several simple heuristics that domain experts are likely to use and implement. By focusing on 200 individuals (which is the intervention capacity of Johnson County) who had interacted with both mental health services and the criminal justice system, we predicted jail bookings in the following year with 51% precision, which outperforms a baseline heuristic model by 1.5 times, and is 4.6 times better than a random baseline. This work provides a framework and prototype system for Johnson County as well as many other jurisdictions that are part of the Data Driven Justice Initiative as they develop intervention models to proactively connect social and mental health workers with individuals in need of care to avoid incarceration.",COMPASS
Predicting Hurricane Trajectories Using a Recurrent Neural Network,2019,"Hurricanes are cyclones circulating about a defined center whose closed wind speeds exceed 75 mph originating over tropical and subtropical waters. At landfall, hurricanes can result in severe disasters. The accuracy of predicting their trajectory paths is critical to reduce economic loss and save human lives. Given the complexity and nonlinearity of weather data, a recurrent neural network (RNN) could be beneficial in modeling hurricane behavior. We propose the application of a fully connected RNN to predict the trajectory of hurricanes. We employed the RNN over a fine grid to reduce typical truncation errors. We utilized their latitude, longitude, wind speed, and pressure publicly provided by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to predict the trajectory of a hurricane at 6-hour intervals. Results show that this proposed technique is competitive to methods currently employed by the NHC and can predict up to approximately 120 hours of hurricane path.",AAAI
"Data-Driven Agent-Based Modeling, with Application to Rooftop Solar Adoption (Page 513)",2015,"Agent-based modeling is commonly used for studying complex system properties emergent from interactions among many agents. We present a novel data-driven agent-based modeling framework applied to forecasting individual and aggregate residential rooftop solar adoption in San Diego county. Our first step is to learn a model of individual agent behavior from combined data of individual adoption characteristics and property assessment. We then construct an agent-based simulation with the learned model embedded in artificial agents, and proceed to validate it using a holdout sequence of collective adoption decisions. We demonstrate that the resulting agent-based model successfully forecasts solar adoption trends and provides a meaningful quantification of uncertainty about its predictions. We utilize our model to optimize two classes of policies aimed at spurring solar adoption: one that subsidizes the cost of adoption, and another that gives away free systems to low-income households. We find that the optimal policies derived for the latter class are significantly more efficacious, whereas the policies similar to the current California Solar Initiative incentive scheme appear to have a limited impact on overall adoption trends.",AAMAS
Crime Rate Inference with Big Data,2016,"Crime is one of the most important social problems in the country, affecting public safety, children development, and adult socioeconomic status. Understanding what factors cause higher crime is critical for policy makers in their efforts to reduce crime and increase citizens' life quality. We tackle a fundamental problem in our paper: crime rate inference at the neighborhood level. Traditional approaches have used demographics and geographical influences to estimate crime rates in a region. With the fast development of positioning technology and prevalence of mobile devices, a large amount of modern urban data have been collected and such big data can provide new perspectives for understanding crime. In this paper, we used large-scale Point-Of-Interest data and taxi flow data in the city of Chicago, IL in the USA. We observed significantly improved performance in crime rate inference compared to using traditional features. Such an improvement is consistent over multiple years. We also show that these new features are significant in the feature importance analysis.",KDD
Systematic Conservation Planning for Sustainable Land-use Policies: A Constrained Partitioning Approach to Reserve Selection and Design.,2019,"Faced with natural habitat degradation, fragmentation, and destruction, it is a major challenge for environmental managers to implement sustainable land use policies promoting socioeconomic development and natural habitat conservation in a balanced way. Relying on artificial intelligence and operational research, reserve selection and design models can be of assistance. This paper introduces a partitioning approach based on Constraint Programming (CP) for the reserve selection and design problem, dealing with both coverage and complex spatial constraints. Moreover, it introduces the first CP formulation of the buffer zone constraint, which can be reused to compose more complex spatial constraints. This approach has been evaluated in a real-world dataset addressing the problem of forest fragmentation in New Caledonia, a biodiversity hotspot where managers are gaining interest in integrating these methods into their decisional processes. Through several scenarios, it showed expressiveness, flexibility, and ability to quickly find solutions to complex questions.",IJCAI
SmartShift: Expanded Load Shifting Incentive Mechanism for Risk-Averse Consumers,2015,"Peak demand for electricity continues to surge around the world. The supply-demand imbalance manifests itself in many forms, from rolling brownouts in California to power cuts in India. It is often suggested that exposing consumers to real-time pricing, will incentivize them to change their usage and mitigate the problem - akin to increasing tolls at peak commute times. We show that risk-averse consumers of electricity react to price fluctuations by scaling back on their total demand, not just their peak demand, leading to the unintended consequence of an overall decrease in production/consumption and reduced economic efficiency. We propose a new scheme that allows homes to move their demands from peak hours in exchange for greater electricity consumption in non-peak hours - akin to how airlines incentivize a passenger to move from an over-booked flight in exchange for, say, two tickets in the future. We present a formal framework for the incentive model that is applicable to different forms of the electricity market. We show that our scheme not only enables increased consumption and consumer social welfare but also allows the distribution company to increase profits. This is achieved by allowing load to be shifted while insulating consumers from real-time price fluctuations. This win-win is important if these methods are to be embraced in practice.",AAAI
"Improving management of aquatic invasions by integrating shipping network, ecological, and environmental data: data mining for social good",2014,"The unintentional transport of invasive species (i.e., non-native and harmful species that adversely affect habitats and native species) through the Global Shipping Network (GSN) causes substantial losses to social and economic welfare (e.g., annual losses due to ship-borne invasions in the Laurentian Great Lakes is estimated to be as high as USD 800 million). Despite the huge negative impacts, management of such invasions remains challenging because of the complex processes that lead to species transport and establishment. Numerous difficulties associated with quantitative risk assessments (e.g., inadequate characterizations of invasion processes, lack of crucial data, large uncertainties associated with available data, etc.) have hampered the usefulness of such estimates in the task of supporting the authorities who are battling to manage invasions with limited resources. We present here an approach for addressing the problem at hand via creative use of computational techniques and multiple data sources, thus illustrating how data mining can be used for solving crucial, yet very complex problems towards social good. By modeling implicit species exchanges as a network that we refer to as the Species Flow Network (SFN), large-scale species flow dynamics are studied via a graph clustering approach that decomposes the SFN into clusters of ports and inter-cluster connections. We then exploit this decomposition to discover crucial knowledge on how patterns in GSN affect aquatic invasions, and then illustrate how such knowledge can be used to devise effective and economical invasive species management strategies. By experimenting on actual GSN traffic data for years 1997-2006, we have discovered crucial knowledge that can significantly aid the management authorities.",KDD
DyETC: Dynamic Electronic Toll Collection for Traffic Congestion Alleviation,2018,"To alleviate traffic congestion in urban areas, electronic toll collection (ETC) systems are deployed all over the world. Despite the merits, tolls are usually pre-determined and fixed from day to day, which fail to consider traffic dynamics and thus have limited regulation effect when traffic conditions are abnormal. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic ETC (DyETC) scheme which adjusts tolls to traffic conditions in realtime. The DyETC problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP), the solution of which is very challenging due to its 1) multi-dimensional state space, 2) multi-dimensional, continuous and bounded action space, and 3) time-dependent state and action values. Due to the complexity of the formulated MDP, existing methods cannot be applied to our problem. Therefore, we develop a novel algorithm, PG-beta, which makes three improvements to traditional policy gradient method by proposing 1) time-dependent value and policy functions, 2) Beta distribution policy function and 3) state abstraction. Experimental results show that, compared with existing ETC schemes, DyETC increases traffic volume by around 8%, and reduces travel time by around 14:6% during rush hour. Considering the total traffic volume in a traffic network, this contributes to a substantial increase to social welfare.",AAAI
Approximately Stable Pricing for Coordinated Purchasing of Electricity,2015,"Matching markets are often used in exchange settings (e.g., supply chain) to increase economic efficiency while respecting certain global constraints on outcomes. We investigate their application to pricing and cost sharing in group purchasing of electricity in smart grid settings. The task is complicated by the complexities of producer cost functions due to constraints on generation from different sources (they are sufficiently complex that welfare-optimal matchings are not usually in equilibrium). We develop two novel cost sharing schemes: one based on Shapley values that is ""fair,"" but computationally intensive; and one that captures many of the essential properties of Shapley pricing, but scales to large numbers of consumers. Empirical results show these schemes achieve a high degree of stability in practice and can be made more stable by sacrificing small amounts (< 2%) of social welfare.",IJCAI
Challenges in Materials Discovery &mdash; Synthetic Generator and Real Datasets,2014,"Newly-discovered materials have been central to recent technological advances. They have contributed significantly to breakthroughs in electronics, renewable energy and green buildings, and overall, have promoted the advancement of global human welfare. Yet, only a fraction of all possible materials have been explored. Accelerating the pace of discovery of materials would foster technological innovations, and would potentially address pressing issues in sustainability, such as energy production or consumption. The bottleneck of this discovery cycle lies, however, in the analysis of the materials data. As materials scientists have recently devised techniques to efficiently create thousands of materials and experimentalists have developed new methods and tools to characterize these materials, the limiting factor has become the data analysis itself. Hence, the goal of this paper is to stimulate the development of new computational techniques for the analysis of materials data, by bringing together the complimentary expertise of materials scientists and computer scientists. In collaboration with two major research laboratories in materials science, we provide the first publicly available dataset for the phase map identification problem. In addition, we provide a parameterized synthetic data generator to assess the quality of proposed approaches, as well as tools for data visualization and solution evaluation.",AAAI
Selecting Compliant Agents for Opt-in Micro-Tolling,2019,"This paper examines the impact of tolls on social welfare in the context of a transportation network in which only a portion of the agents are subject to tolls. More specifically, this paper addresses the question: which subset of agents provides the most system benefit if they are compliant with an approximate marginal cost tolling scheme? Since previous work suggests this problem is NP-hard, we examine a heuristic approach. Our experimental results on three real-world traffic scenarios suggest that evaluating the marginal impact of a given agent serves as a particularly strong heuristic for selecting an agent to be compliant. Results from using this heuristic for selecting 7.6% of the agents to be compliant achieved an increase of up to 10.9% in social welfare over not tolling at all. The presented heuristic approach and conclusions can help practitioners target specific agents to participate in an opt-in tolling scheme.",AAAI
Anonymizing set-valued data by nonreciprocal recoding,2012,"Today there is a strong interest in publishing set-valued data in a privacy-preserving manner. Such data associate individuals to sets of values (e.g., preferences, shopping items, symptoms, query logs). In addition, an individual can be associated with a sensitive label (e.g., marital status, religious or political conviction). Anonymizing such data implies ensuring that an adversary should not be able to (1) identify an individual's record, and (2) infer a sensitive label, if such exists. Existing research on this problem either perturbs the data, publishes them in disjoint groups disassociated from their sensitive labels, or generalizes their values by assuming the availability of a generalization hierarchy. In this paper, we propose a novel alternative. Our publication method also puts data in a generalized form, but does not require that published records form disjoint groups and does not assume a hierarchy either; instead, it employs generalized bitmaps and recasts data values in a nonreciprocal manner; formally, the bipartite graph from original to anonymized records does not have to be composed of disjoint complete subgraphs. We configure our schemes to provide popular privacy guarantees while resisting attacks proposed in recent research, and demonstrate experimentally that we gain a clear utility advantage over the previous state of the art.",KDD
Adaptive adversaries: building systems to fight fraud and cyber intruders,2013,"Statistical machine learning / knowledge discovery techniques tend to fail when faced with an adaptive adversary attempting to evade detection in the data. Humans do an excellent job of correctly spotting adaptive adversaries given a good way to digest the data. On the other hand, humans are glacially slow and error-prone when it comes to moving through very large volumes of data, a task best left to the machines. Fighting complex fraud and cyber-security threats requires a symbiosis between the computers and teams of human analysts. The computers use algorithmic analysis, heuristics, and/or statistical characterization to find interesting 'simple' patterns in the data. These candidate events are then queued for in-depth human analysis in rich, expressive, interactive analysis environments.
 In this talk, we'll take a look at case studies of three different systems, using a partnership of automation and human analysis on large scale data to find the clandestine human behavior that these datasets hold, including a discussion of the backend systems architecture and a demo of the interactive analysis environment.
 The backend systems architecture is a mix of open source technologies, like Cassandra, Lucene, and Hadoop, and some new components that bind them all together. The interactive analysis environment allows seamless pivoting between semantic, geospatial, and temporal analysis with a powerful GUI interface that's usable by non-data scientists. The systems are real systems currently in use by commercial banks, pharmaceutical companies, and governments.",KDD
Power Grid Defense Against Malicious Cascading Failure (Page 813),2014,"An adversary looking to disrupt a power grid may look to target certain substations and sources of power generation to initiate a cascading failure that maximizes the number of customers without electricity. This is particularly an important concern when the enemy has the capability to launch cyber-attacks as practical concerns (i.e. avoiding disruption of service, presence of legacy systems, etc.) may hinder security. Hence, a defender can harden the security posture at certain power stations but may lack the time and resources to do this for the entire power grid. We model a power grid as a graph and introduce the cascading failure game in which both the defender and attacker choose a subset of power stations such as to minimize (maximize) the number of consumers having access to producers of power. We formalize problems for identifying both mixed and deterministic strategies for both players, prove complexity results under a variety of different scenarios, identify tractable cases, and develop algorithms for these problems. We also perform an experimental evaluation of the model and game on a real-world power grid network. Empirically, we noted that the game favors the attacker as he benefits more from increased resources than the defender. Further, the minimax defense produces roughly the same expected payoff as an easy-to-compute deterministic load based (DLB) defense when played against a minimax attack strategy. However, DLB performs more poorly than minimax defense when faced with the attacker's best response to DLB. This is likely due to the presence of low-load yet high-payoff nodes, which we also found in our empirical analysis.",AAMAS
k-CoRating: Filling Up Data to Obtain Privacy and Utility,2014,"For datasets in Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommendations, even if the identifier is deleted and some trivial perturbation operations are applied to ratings before they are released, there are research results claiming that the adversary could discriminate the individual's identity with a little bit of information. In this paper, we propose $k$-coRating, a novel privacy-preserving model, to retain data privacy by replacing some null ratings with ""well-predicted"" scores. They do not only mask the original ratings such that a $k$-anonymity-like data privacy is preserved, but also enhance the data utility (measured by prediction accuracy in this paper), which shows that the traditional assumption that accuracy and privacy are two goals in conflict is not necessarily correct. We show that the optimal $k$-coRated mapping is an NP-hard problem and design a naive but efficient algorithm to achieve $k$-coRating. All claims are verified by experimental results.",AAAI
Differentially private data release for data mining,2011,"Privacy-preserving data publishing addresses the problem of disclosing sensitive data when mining for useful information. Among the existing privacy models, Ã¢ËË-differential privacy provides one of the strongest privacy guarantees and has no assumptions about an adversary's background knowledge. Most of the existing solutions that ensure Ã¢ËË-differential privacy are based on an interactive model, where the data miner is only allowed to pose aggregate queries to the database. In this paper, we propose the first anonymization algorithm for the non-interactive setting based on the generalization technique. The proposed solution first probabilistically generalizes the raw data and then adds noise to guarantee Ã¢ËË-differential privacy. As a sample application, we show that the anonymized data can be used effectively to build a decision tree induction classifier. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed non-interactive anonymization algorithm is scalable and performs better than the existing solutions for classification analysis.",KDD
Composition attacks and auxiliary information in data privacy,2008,"Privacy is an increasingly important aspect of data publishing. Reasoning about privacy, however, is fraught with pitfalls. One of the most significant is the auxiliary information (also called external knowledge, background knowledge, or side information) that an adversary gleans from other channels such as the web, public records, or domain knowledge. This paper explores how one can reason about privacy in the face of rich, realistic sources of auxiliary information. Specifically, we investigate the effectiveness of current anonymization schemes in preserving privacy when multiple organizations independently release anonymized data about overlapping populations.
 1. We investigate composition attacks, in which an adversary uses independent anonymized releases to breach privacy. We explain why recently proposed models of limited auxiliary information fail to capture composition attacks. Our experiments demonstrate that even a simple instance of a composition attack can breach privacy in practice, for a large class of currently proposed techniques. The class includes k-anonymity and several recent variants.
 2. On a more positive note, certain randomization-based notions of privacy (such as differential privacy) provably resist composition attacks and, in fact, the use of arbitrary side information.This resistance enables ""stand-alone"" design of anonymization schemes, without the need for explicitly keeping track of other releases.
 We provide a precise formulation of this property, and prove that an important class of relaxations of differential privacy also satisfy the property. This significantly enlarges the class of protocols known to enable modular design.",KDD
Playing Repeated Network Interdiction Games with Semi-Bandit Feedback,2017,"We study repeated network interdiction games with no prior knowledge of the adversary and the environment, which can model many real world network security domains. Existing works often require plenty of available information for the defender and neglect the frequent interactions between both players, which are unrealistic and impractical, and thus, are not suitable for our settings. As such, we provide the first defender strategy, that enjoys nice theoretical and practical performance guarantees, by applying the adversarial online learning approach. In particular, we model the repeated network interdiction game with no prior knowledge as an online linear optimization problem, for which a novel and efficient online learning algorithm, SBGA, is proposed, which exploits the unique semi-bandit feedback in network security domains. We prove that SBGA achieves sublinear regret against adaptive adversary, compared with both the best fixed strategy in hindsight and a near optimal adaptive strategy. Extensive experiments also show that SBGA significantly outperforms existing approaches with fast convergence rate.",IJCAI
Adversarial Matching of Dark Net Market Vendor Accounts,2019,"Many datasets feature seemingly disparate entries that actually refer to the same entity. Reconciling these entries, or ""matching,"" is challenging, especially in situations where there are errors in the data. In certain contexts, the situation is even more complicated: an active adversary may have a vested interest in having the matching process fail. By leveraging eight years of data, we investigate one such adversarial context: matching different online anonymous marketplace vendor handles to unique sellers. Using a combination of random forest classifiers and hierarchical clustering on a set of features that would be hard for an adversary to forge or mimic, we manage to obtain reasonable performance (over 75% precision and recall on labels generated using heuristics), despite generally lacking any ground truth for training. Our algorithm performs particularly well for the top 30% of accounts by sales volume, and hints that 22,163 accounts with at least one confirmed sale map to 15,652 distinct sellers---of which 12,155 operate only one account, and the remainder between 2 and 11 different accounts. Case study analysis further confirms that our algorithm manages to identify non-trivial matches, as well as impersonation attempts.",KDD
Towards scalable critical alert mining,2014,"Performance monitor software for data centers typically generates a great number of alert sequences. These alert sequences indicate abnormal network events. Given a set of observed alert sequences, it is important to identify the most critical alerts that are potentially the causes of others. While the need for mining critical alerts over large scale alert sequences is evident, most alert analysis techniques stop at modeling and mining the causal relations among the alerts.
 This paper studies the critical alert mining problem: Given a set of alert sequences, we aim to find a set of k critical alerts such that the number of alerts potentially triggered by them is maximized. We show that the problem is intractable; therefore, we resort to approximation and heuristic algorithms. First, we develop an approximation algorithm that obtains a near-optimal alert set in quadratic time, and propose pruning techniques to improve its runtime performance. Moreover, we show a faster approximation exists, when the alerts follow certain causal structure. Second, we propose two fast heuristic algorithms based on tree sampling techniques. On real-life data, these algorithms identify a critical alert from up to 270,000 mined causal relations in 5 seconds; meanwhile, they preserve more than 80% of solution quality, and are up to 5,000 times faster than their approximation counterparts.",KDD
Real-time Alert Correlation Using Stream Data Mining Techniques,2008,"With the large volume of alerts produced by low-level detectors, management of intrusion alerts is becoming more challenging. Alert Correlation addresses this issue by providing a condensed, yet more useful view of the network from the intrusion standpoint. In this paper, we propose a new framework for real-time alert correlation that incorporates novel techniques for aggregating alerts into structured patterns and incremental mining of frequent structured patterns. In the proposed framework, time-sensitive statistical relationships between alerts are maintained in an efficient data structure and are updated incrementally to reflect the latest trends of patterns. The results of experiments with synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed techniques. Our Frequent Structure Mining algorithm scales linearly with the size of the dataset and the proposed framework can cope with the throughput of a large-scale network. The ability to answer time-sensitive queries about patterns is another advantage of this work compared to other methods.",AAAI
Unveiling clusters of events for alert and incident management in large-scale enterprise it,2014,"Large enterprise IT (Information Technology) infrastructure components generate large volumes of alerts and incident tickets. These are manually screened, but it is otherwise difficult to extract information automatically from them to gain insights in order to improve operational efficiency. We propose a framework to cluster alerts and incident tickets based on the text in them, using unsupervised machine learning. This would be a step towards eliminating manual classification of the alerts and incidents, which is very labor intense and costly. Our framework can handle the semi-structured text in alerts generated by IT infrastructure components such as storage devices, network devices, servers etc., as well as the unstructured text in incident tickets created manually by operations support personnel. After text pre-processing and application of appropriate distance metrics, we apply different graph-theoretic approaches to cluster the alerts and incident tickets, based on their semi-structured and unstructured text respectively. For automated interpretation and read-ability on semi-structured text clusters, we propose a method to visualize clusters that preserves the structure and human-readability of the text data as compared to traditional word clouds where the text structure is not preserved; for unstructured text clusters, we find a simple way to define prototypes of clusters for easy interpretation. This framework for clustering and visualization will enable enterprises to prioritize the issues in their IT infrastructure and improve the reliability and availability of their services.",KDD
Multi-label Learning with Highly Incomplete Data via Collaborative Embedding,2018,"Tremendous efforts have been dedicated to improving the effectiveness of multi-label learning with incomplete label assignments. Most of the current techniques assume that the input features of data instances are complete. Nevertheless, the co-occurrence of highly incomplete features and weak label assignments is a challenging and widely perceived issue in real-world multi-label learning applications due to a number of practical reasons including incomplete data collection, moderate labels from annotators, etc. Existing multi-label learning algorithms are not directly applicable when the observed features are highly incomplete. In this work, we attack this problem by proposing a weakly supervised multi-label learning approach, based on the idea of collaborative embedding. This approach provides a flexible framework to conduct efficient multi-label classification at both transductive and inductive mode by coupling the process of reconstructing missing features and weak label assignments in a joint optimisation framework. It is designed to collaboratively recover feature and label information, and extract the predictive association between the feature profile and the multi-label tag of the same data instance. Substantial experiments on public benchmark datasets and real security event data validate that our proposed method can provide distinctively more accurate transductive and inductive classification than other state-of-the-art algorithms.",KDD
Staying Ahead of the Game: Adaptive Robust Optimization for Dynamic Allocation of Threat Screening Resources,2017,"We consider the problem of dynamically allocating screening resources of different efficacies (e.g., magnetic or X-ray imaging) at checkpoints (e.g., at airports or ports) to successfully avert an attack by one of the screenees. Previously, the Threat Screening Game model was introduced to address this problem under the assumption that screenee arrival times are perfectly known. In reality, arrival times are uncertain, which severely impedes the implementability and performance of this approach. We thus propose a novel framework for dynamic allocation of threat screening resources that explicitly accounts for uncertainty in the screenee arrival times. We model the problem as a multistage robust optimization problem and propose a tractable solution approach using compact linear decision rules combined with robust reformulation and constraint randomization. We perform extensive numerical experiments which showcase that our approach outperforms (a) exact solution methods in terms of tractability, while incurring only a very minor loss in optimality, and (b) methods that ignore uncertainty in terms of both feasibility and optimality.",IJCAI
Defending Against Man-In-The-Middle Attack in Repeated Games,2017,"The Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack has become widespread in networks nowadays. The MITM attack would cause serious information leakage and result in tremendous loss to users. Previous work applies game theory to analyze the MITM attack-defense problem and computes the optimal defense strategy to minimize the total loss. It assumes that all defenders are cooperative and the attacker know defenders' strategies beforehand. However, each individual defender is rational and may not have the incentive to cooperate. Furthermore, the attacker can hardly know defenders' strategies ahead of schedule in practice. To this end, we assume that all defenders are self-interested and model the MITM attack-defense scenario as a simultaneous-move game. Nash equilibrium is adopted as the solution concept which is proved to be always unique. Given the impracticability of computing Nash equilibrium directly, we propose practical adaptive algorithms for the defenders and the attacker to learn towards the unique Nash equilibrium through repeated interactions. Simulation results show that the algorithms are able to converge to Nash equilibrium strategy efficiently.",IJCAI
Efficient Label Contamination Attacks Against Black-Box Learning Models,2017,"Label contamination attack (LCA) is an important type of data poisoning attack where an attacker manipulates the labels of training data to make the learned model beneficial to him. Existing work on LCA assumes that the attacker has full knowledge of the victim learning model, whereas the victim model is usually a black-box to the attacker. In this paper, we develop a Projected Gradient Ascent (PGA) algorithm to compute LCAs on a family of empirical risk minimizations and show that an attack on one victim model can also be effective on other victim models. This makes it possible that the attacker designs an attack against a substitute model and transfers it to a black-box victim model. Based on the observation of the transferability, we develop a defense algorithm to identify the data points that are most likely to be attacked. Empirical studies show that PGA significantly outperforms existing baselines and linear learning models are better substitute models than nonlinear ones.",IJCAI
One-Class Adversarial Nets for Fraud Detection,2019,"Many online applications, such as online social networks or knowledge bases, are often attacked by malicious users who commit different types of actions such as vandalism on Wikipedia or fraudulent reviews on eBay. Currently, most of the fraud detection approaches require a training dataset that contains records of both benign and malicious users. However, in practice, there are often no or very few records of malicious users. In this paper, we develop one-class adversarial nets (OCAN) for fraud detection with only benign users as training data. OCAN first uses LSTM-Autoencoder to learn the representations of benign users from their sequences of online activities. It then detects malicious users by training a discriminator of a complementary GAN model that is different from the regular GAN model. Experimental results show that our OCAN outperforms the state-of-the-art oneclass classification models and achieves comparable performance with the latest multi-source LSTM model that requires both benign and malicious users in the training phase.",AAAI
Personal privacy vs population privacy: learning to attack anonymization,2011,"Over the last decade great strides have been made in developing techniques to compute functions privately. In particular, Differential Privacy gives strong promises about conclusions that can be drawn about an individual. In contrast, various syntactic methods for providing privacy (criteria such as k-anonymity and l-diversity) have been criticized for still allowing private information of an individual to be inferred. In this paper, we consider the ability of an attacker to use data meeting privacy definitions to build an accurate classifier. We demonstrate that even under Differential Privacy, such classifiers can be used to infer ""private"" attributes accurately in realistic data. We compare this to similar approaches for inference-based attacks on other forms of anonymized data. We show how the efficacy of all these attacks can be measured on the same scale, based on the probability of successfully inferring a private attribute. We observe that the accuracy of inference of private attributes for differentially private data and $l$-diverse data can be quite similar.",KDD
Top-k frequent itemsets via differentially private FP-trees,2014,"Frequent itemset mining is a core data mining task and has been studied extensively. Although by their nature, frequent itemsets are aggregates over many individuals and would not seem to pose a privacy threat, an attacker with strong background information can learn private individual information from frequent itemsets. This has lead to differentially private frequent itemset mining, which protects privacy by giving inexact answers. We give an approach that first identifies top-k frequent itemsets, then uses them to construct a compact, differentially private FP-tree. Once the noisy FP-tree is built, the (privatized) support of all frequent itemsets can be derived from it without access to the original data. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm gives substantially better results than prior approaches, especially for high levels of privacy.",KDD
A Minimax Game for Instance based Selective Transfer Learning,2019,"Deep neural network based transfer learning has been widely used to leverage information from the domain with rich data to help domain with insufficient data. When the source data distribution is different from the target data, transferring knowledge between these domains may lead to negative transfer. To mitigate this problem, a typical way is to select useful source domain data for transferring. However, limited studies focus on selecting high-quality source data to help neural network based transfer learning. To bridge this gap, we propose a general Minimax Game based model for selective Transfer Learning (MGTL). More specifically, we build a selector, a discriminator and a TL module in the proposed method. The discriminator aims to maximize the differences between selected source data and target data, while the selector acts as an attacker to selected source data that are close to the target to minimize the differences. The TL module trains on the selected data and provides rewards to guide the selector. Those three modules play a minimax game to help select useful source data for transferring. Our method is also shown to speed up the training process of the learning task in the target domain than traditional TL methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first to build a minimax game based model for selective transfer learning. To examine the generality of our method, we evaluate it on two different tasks: item recommendation and text retrieval. Extensive experiments over both public and real-world datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the competing methods by a large margin. Meanwhile, the quantitative evaluation shows our model can select data which are close to target data. Our model is also deployed in a real-world system and significant improvement over the baselines is observed.",KDD
TimeCrunch: Interpretable Dynamic Graph Summarization,2015,"How can we describe a large, dynamic graph over time? Is it random? If not, what are the most apparent deviations from randomness -- a dense block of actors that persists over time, or perhaps a star with many satellite nodes that appears with some fixed periodicity? In practice, these deviations indicate patterns -- for example, botnet attackers forming a bipartite core with their victims over the duration of an attack, family members bonding in a clique-like fashion over a difficult period of time, or research collaborations forming and fading away over the years. Which patterns exist in real-world dynamic graphs, and how can we find and rank them in terms of importance? These are exactly the problems we focus on in this work. Our main contributions are (a) formulation: we show how to formalize this problem as minimizing the encoding cost in a data compression paradigm, (b) algorithm: we propose TIMECRUNCH, an effective, scalable and parameter-free method for finding coherent, temporal patterns in dynamic graphs and (c) practicality: we apply our method to several large, diverse real-world datasets with up to 36 million edges and 6.3 million nodes. We show that TIMECRUNCH is able to compress these graphs by summarizing important temporal structures and finds patterns that agree with intuition.",KDD
Secure Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks via POMDPs,2015,"Wireless sensor networks are being increasingly used for sustainable development. The task of routing in these resource-constraint networks is particularly challenging as they operate over prolonged deployment periods, necessitating optimal use of their resources. Moreover, due to the deployment in unattended environments, they become an easy target for attackers. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical POMDP based approach to make routing decisions with partial/limited information about the sensor nodes, in a secure and energy-efficient manner. We demonstrate in a large-scale simulation that the approach provides a better energy/packet delivery tradeoff than competing methods, and also validate these conclusions in a real-world testbed.",IJCAI
A Machine Learning Based System for Semi-Automatically Redacting Documents,2011,"Redacting text documents has traditionally been a mostly manual activity, making it expensive and prone to disclosure risks. This paper describes a semi-automated system to ensure a specified level of privacy in text data sets. Recent work has attempted to quantify the likelihood of privacy breaches for text data. We build on these notions to provide a means of obstructing such breaches by framing it as a multi-class classification problem. Our system gives users fine-grained control over the level of privacy needed to obstruct sensitive concepts present in that data. Additionally, our system is designed to respect a user-defined utility metric on the data (such as disclosure of a particular concept), which our methods try to maximize while anonymizing. We describe our redaction framework, algorithms, as well as a prototype tool built in to Microsoft Word that allows enterprise users to redact documents before sharing them internally and obscure client specific information. In addition we show experimental evaluation using publicly available data sets that show the effectiveness of our approach against both automated attackers and human subjects.The results show that we are able to preserve the utility of a text corpus while reducing disclosure risk of the sensitive concept.",AAAI
HinDroid: An Intelligent Android Malware Detection System Based on Structured Heterogeneous Information Network,2017,"With explosive growth of Android malware and due to the severity of its damages to smart phone users, the detection of Android malware has become increasingly important in cybersecurity. The increasing sophistication of Android malware calls for new defensive techniques that are capable against novel threats and harder to evade. In this paper, to detect Android malware, instead of using Application Programming Interface (API) calls only, we further analyze the different relationships between them and create higher-level semantics which require more effort for attackers to evade the detection. We represent the Android applications (apps), related APIs, and their rich relationships as a structured heterogeneous information network (HIN). Then we use a meta-path based approach to characterize the semantic relatedness of apps and APIs. We use each meta-path to formulate a similarity measure over Android apps, and aggregate different similarities using multi-kernel learning. Then each meta-path is automatically weighted by the learning algorithm to make predictions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use structured HIN for Android malware detection. Comprehensive experiments on real sample collections from Comodo Cloud Security Center are conducted to compare various malware detection approaches. Promising experimental results demonstrate that our developed system HinDroid outperforms other alternative Android malware detection techniques.",KDD
Mining for Causal Relationships: A Data-Driven Study of the Islamic State,2015,"The Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) is a dominant insurgent group operating in Iraq and Syria that rose to prominence when it took over Mosul in June, 2014. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach to analyzing this group using a dataset consisting of 2200 incidents of military activity surrounding ISIS and the forces that oppose it (including Iraqi, Syrian, and the American-led coalition). We combine ideas from logic programming and causal reasoning to mine for association rules for which we present evidence of causality. We present relationships that link ISIS vehicle-bourne improvised explosive device (VBIED) activity in Syria with military operations in Iraq, coalition air strikes, and ISIS IED activity, as well as rules that may serve as indicators of spikes in indirect fire, suicide attacks, and arrests.",KDD
Certifiable Robustness and Robust Training for Graph Convolutional Networks,2019,"Recent works show that Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are highly non-robust with respect to adversarial attacks on both the graph structure and the node attributes, making their outcomes unreliable. We propose the first method for certifiable (non-)robustness of graph convolutional networks with respect to perturbations of the node attributes. We consider the case of binary node attributes (e.g. bag-of-words) and perturbations that are L_0-bounded. If a node has been certified with our method, it is guaranteed to be robust under any possible perturbation given the attack model. Likewise, we can certify non-robustness. Finally, we propose a robust semi-supervised training procedure that treats the labeled and unlabeled nodes jointly. As shown in our experimental evaluation, our method significantly improves the robustness of the GNN with only minimal effect on the predictive accuracy.",KDD
Identify Susceptible Locations in Medical Records via Adversarial Attacks on Deep Predictive Models,2018,"The surging availability of electronic medical records (EHR) leads to increased research interests in medical predictive modeling. Recently many deep learning based predicted models are also developed for EHR data and demonstrated impressive performance. However, a series of recent studies showed that these deep models are not safe: they suffer from certain vulnerabilities. In short, a well-trained deep network can be extremely sensitive to inputs with negligible changes. These inputs are referred to as adversarial examples. In the context of medical informatics, such attacks could alter the result of a high performance deep predictive model by slightly perturbing a patient's medical records. Such instability not only reflects the weakness of deep architectures, more importantly, it offers a guide on detecting susceptible parts on the inputs. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective framework that learns a time-preferential minimum attack targeting the LSTM model with EHR inputs, and we leverage this attack strategy to screen medical records of patients and identify susceptible events and measurements. The efficient screening procedure can assist decision makers to pay extra attentions to the locations that can cause severe consequence if not measured correctly. We conduct extensive empirical studies on a real-world urgent care cohort and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed screening.",KDD
Who Should Pay the Cost: A Game-theoretic Model for Government Subsidized Investments to Improve National Cybersecurity,2019,"Due to the recent cyber attacks, cybersecurity is becoming more critical in modern society. A single attack (e.g., WannaCry ransomware attack) can cause as much as $4 billion in damage. However, the cybersecurity investment by companies is far from satisfactory. Therefore, governments (e.g., in the UK) launch grants and subsidies to help companies to boost their cybersecurity to create a safer national cyber environment. The allocation problem is hard due to limited subsidies and the interdependence between self-interested companies and the presence of a strategic cyber attacker. To tackle the government's allocation problem, we introduce a Stackelberg game-theoretic model where the government first commits to an allocation and the companies/users and attacker simultaneously determine their protection and attack (pure or mixed) strategies, respectively. For the pure-strategy case, while there may not be a feasible allocation in general, we prove that computing an optimal allocation is NP-hard and propose a linear reverse convex program when the attacker can attack all users. For the mixed-strategy case, we show that there is a polynomial time algorithm to find an optimal allocation when the attacker has a single-attack capability. We then provide a heuristic algorithm, based on best-response-gradient dynamics, to find an effective allocation in the general setting. Experimentally, we show that our heuristic is effective and outperforms other baselines on synthetic and real data.",IJCAI
Multiagent Router Throttling: Decentralized Coordinated Response Against DDoS Attacks,2013,"Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks constitute a rapidly evolving threat in the current Internet. In this paper we introduce Multiagent Router Throttling, a decentralized DDoS response mechanism in which a set of upstream routers independently learn to throttle traffic towards a victim server. We compare our approach against a baseline and a popular throttling technique from the literature, and we show that our proposed approach is more secure, reliable and cost-effective. Furthermore, our approach outperforms the baseline technique and either outperforms or has the same performance as the popular one.",AAAI
Explicit Defense Actions Against Test-Set Attacks,2017,"Automated learning and decision making systems in public-facing applications are vulnerable to malicious attacks. Examples of such systems include spam detectors, credit card fraud detectors, and network intrusion detection systems. These systems are at further risk of attack when money is directly involved, such as market forecasters or decision systems used in determining insurance or loan rates. In this paper, we consider the setting where a predictor Bob has a fixed model, and an unknown attacker Alice aims to perturb (or poison) future test instances so as to alter Bob's prediction to her benefit. We focus specifically on Bob's optimal defense actions to limit Alice's effectiveness. We define a general framework for determining Bob's optimal defense action against Alice's worst-case attack. We then demonstrate our framework by considering linear predictors, where we provide tractable methods of determining the optimal defense action. Using these methods, we perform an empirical investigation of optimal defense actions for a particular class of linear models -- autoregressive forecasters -- and find that for ten real world futures markets, the optimal defense action reduces the Bob's loss by between 78 and 97%.",AAAI
Estimating the number of users behind ip addresses for combating abusive traffic,2011,"This paper addresses estimating the number of the users of a specific application behind IP addresses (IPs). This problem is central to combating abusive traffic, such as DDoS attacks, ad click fraud and email spam. We share our experience building a general framework at Google for estimating the number of users behind IPs, called hereinafter the sizes of the IPs. The primary goal of this framework is combating abusive traffic without violating the user privacy. The estimation techniques produce statistically sound estimates of sizes relying solely on passively mining aggregated application log data, without probing machines or deploying active content like Java applets. This paper also explores using the estimated sizes to detect and filter abusive traffic. The proposed framework was used to build and deploy an ad click fraud filter at Google. The first 50M clicks tagged by the filter had a significant recall of all tagged clicks, and their false positive rate was below 1.4%. For the sake of comparison, we simulated a naive IP-based filter that does not consider the sizes of the IPs. To reach a comparable recall, the naive filter's false positive rate was 37% due to aggressive tagging.",KDD
SpotLight: Detecting Anomalies in Streaming Graphs,2018,"How do we spot interesting events from e-mail or transportation logs? How can we detect port scan or denial of service attacks from IP-IP communication data? In general, given a sequence of weighted, directed or bipartite graphs, each summarizing a snapshot of activity in a time window, how can we spot anomalous graphs containing the sudden appearance or disappearance of large dense subgraphs (e.g., near bicliques) in near real-time using sublinear memory? To this end, we propose a randomized sketching-based approach called SpotLight, which guarantees that an anomalous graph is mapped 'far' away from 'normal' instances in the sketch space with high probability for appropriate choice of parameters. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that SpotLight (a) improves accuracy by at least 8.4% compared to prior approaches, (b) is fast and can process millions of edges within a few minutes, (c) scales linearly with the number of edges and sketching dimensions and (d) leads to interesting discoveries in practice.",KDD
Leveraging Textual Specifications for Grammar-Based Fuzzing of Network Protocols,2019,Grammar-based fuzzing is a technique used to find software vulnerabilities by injecting well-formed inputs generated following rules that encode application semantics. Most grammar-based fuzzers for network protocols rely on human experts to manually specify these rules. In this work we study automated learning of protocol rules from textual specifications (i.e. RFCs). We evaluate the automatically extracted protocol rules by applying them to a state-of-the-art fuzzer for transport protocols and show that it leads to a smaller number of test cases while finding the same attacks as the system that uses manually specified rules.,AAAI
Exploiting an Oracle That Reports AUC Scores in Machine Learning Contests,2016,"In machine learning contests such as the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge and the KDD Cup, contestants can submit candidate solutions and receive from an oracle (typically the organizers of the competition) the accuracy of their guesses compared to the ground-truth labels. One of the most commonly used accuracy metrics for binary classification tasks is the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC). In this paper we provide proofs-of-concept of how knowledge of the AUC of a set of guesses can be used, in two different kinds of attacks, to improve the accuracy of those guesses. On the other hand, we also demonstrate the intractability of one kind of AUC exploit by proving that the number of possible binary labelings of n examples for which a candidate solution obtains a AUC score of c grows exponentially in n, for every c in (0,1).",AAAI
Abductive Inference for Combat: Using SCARE-S2 to Find High-Value Targets in Afghanistan,2011,"Recently, geospatial abduction was introduced by the authors in [Shakarian et. al. 2010] as a way to infer unobserved geographic phenomena from a set of known observations and constraints between the two. In this paper, we introduce the SCARE-S2 software tool which applies geospatial abduction to the environment of Afghanistan. Unlike previous work, where we looked for small weapon caches supporting local attacks, here we look for insurgent high-value targets (HVT's), supporting insurgent operations in two provinces. These HVT's include the locations of insurgent leaders and major supply depots. Applying this method of inference to Afghanistan introduces several practical issues not addressed in previous work. Namely, we are conducting inference in a much larger area (24,940 sq km as compared to 675 sq km in previous work), on more varied terrain, and must consider the influence of many local tribes. We address all of these problems and evaluate our software on 6 months of real-world counter-insurgency data. We show that we are able to abduce regions of a relatively small area (on average, under 100 sq km and each containing, on average, 4.8 villages) that are more dense with HVT's (35 X more than the overall area considered).",AAAI
Fast and Accurate Anomaly Detection in Dynamic Graphs with a Two-Pronged Approach,2019,"Given a dynamic graph stream, how can we detect the sudden appearance of anomalous patterns, such as link spam, follower boosting, or denial of service attacks? Additionally, can we categorize the types of anomalies that occur in practice, and theoretically analyze the anomalous signs arising from each type? In this work, we propose AnomRank, an online algorithm for anomaly detection in dynamic graphs. AnomRank uses a two-pronged approach defining two novel metrics for anomalousness. Each metric tracks the derivatives of its own version of a 'node score' (or node importance) function. This allows us to detect sudden changes in the importance of any node. We show theoretically and experimentally that the two-pronged approach successfully detects two common types of anomalies: sudden weight changes along an edge, and sudden structural changes to the graph. AnomRank is (a) Fast and Accurate: up to 49.5x faster or 35% more accurate than state-of-the-art methods, (b) Scalable: linear in the number of edges in the input graph, processing millions of edges within 2 seconds on a stock laptop/desktop, and (c) Theoretically Sound: providing theoretical guarantees of the two-pronged approach.",KDD
Auto-WEKA: combined selection and hyperparameter optimization of classification algorithms,2013,"Many different machine learning algorithms exist; taking into account each algorithm's hyperparameters, there is a staggeringly large number of possible alternatives overall. We consider the problem of simultaneously selecting a learning algorithm and setting its hyperparameters, going beyond previous work that attacks these issues separately. We show that this problem can be addressed by a fully automated approach, leveraging recent innovations in Bayesian optimization. Specifically, we consider a wide range of feature selection techniques (combining 3 search and 8 evaluator methods) and all classification approaches implemented in WEKA's standard distribution, spanning 2 ensemble methods, 10 meta-methods, 27 base classifiers, and hyperparameter settings for each classifier. On each of 21 popular datasets from the UCI repository, the KDD Cup 09, variants of the MNIST dataset and CIFAR-10, we show classification performance often much better than using standard selection and hyperparameter optimization methods. We hope that our approach will help non-expert users to more effectively identify machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter settings appropriate to their applications, and hence to achieve improved performance.",KDD
A Trust-based Mixture of Gaussian Processes Model for Reliable Regression in Participatory Sensing,2017,"Data trustworthiness is a crucial issue in real-world participatory sensing applications. Without considering this issue, different types of worker misbehavior, especially the challenging collusion attacks, can result in biased and inaccurate estimation and decision making. We propose a novel trust-based mixture of Gaussian processes (GP) model for spatial regression to jointly detect such misbehavior and accurately estimate the spatial field. We develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based algorithm to efficiently perform Bayesian inference of the model. Experiments using two real-world datasets show the superior robustness of our model compared with existing approaches.",IJCAI
Scalable noise mining in long-term electrocardiographic time-series to predict death following heart attacks,2014,"Cardiac disease is the leading cause of death around the world; with ischemic heart disease alone claiming 7 million lives in 2011. This burden can be attributed, in part, to the absence of biomarkers that can reliably identify high risk patients and match them to treatments that are appropriate for them. In recent clinical studies, we have demonstrated the ability of computation to extract information with substantial prognostic utility that is typically disregarded in time-series data collected from cardiac patients. Of particular interest are subtle variations in long-term electrocardiographic (ECG) data that are usually overlooked as noise but provide a useful assessment of myocardial instability. In multiple clinical cohorts, we have developed the pathophysiological basis for studying probabilistic variations in long-term ECG and demonstrated the ability of this information to effectively risk stratify patients at risk of dying following heart attacks. In this paper, we extend this work and focus on the question of how to reduce its computational complexity for scalable use in large datasets or energy constrained embedded devices. Our basic approach to uncovering pathological structure within the ECG focuses on characterizing beat-to-beat time-warped shape deformations of the ECG using a modified dynamic time-warping (DTW) and Lomb-Scargle periodogram-based algorithm. As part of our efforts to scale this work up, we explore a novel approach to address the quadratic runtime of DTW. We achieve this by developing the idea of adaptive downsampling to reduce the size of the inputs presented to DTW, and describe changes to the dynamic programming problem underlying DTW to exploit adaptively downsampled ECG signals. When evaluated on data from 765 patients in the DISPERSE2-TIMI33 trial, our results show that high morphologic variability is associated with an 8- to 9-fold increased risk of death within 90 days of a heart attack. Moreover, the use of adaptive downsampling with a modified DTW formulation achieves a 7- to almost 20-fold reduction in runtime relative to DTW, without a significant change in biomarker discrimination.",KDD
Collusion-resistant anonymous data collection method,2009,"The availability and the accuracy of the data dictate the success of a data mining application. Increasingly, there is a need to resort to on-line data collection to address the problem of data availability. However, participants in on-line data collection applications are naturally distrustful of the data collector as well as their peer respondents, resulting in inaccurate data collected as the respondents refuse to provide truthful data in fear of collusion attacks. The current anonymity-preserving solutions for on-line data collection are unable to adequately resist such attacks in a scalable fashion. In this paper, we present an efficient anonymous data collection protocol for a malicious environment such as the Internet. The protocol employs cryptographic and random shuffling techniques to preserve participants' anonymity. The proposed method is collusion-resistant and guarantees that an attacker will be unable to breach an honest participant's anonymity unless she controls all N-1 participants. In addition, our method is efficient and achieved 15-42% communication overhead reduction in comparison to the prior state-of-the-art methods.",KDD
Feedback-Guided Anomaly Discovery via Online Optimization,2018,"Anomaly detectors are often used to produce a ranked list of statistical anomalies, which are examined by human analysts in order to extract the actual anomalies of interest. This can be exceedingly difficult and time consuming when most high-ranking anomalies are false positives and not interesting from an application perspective. In this paper, we study how to reduce the analyst's effort by incorporating their feedback about whether the anomalies they investigate are of interest or not. In particular, the feedback will be used to adjust the anomaly ranking after every analyst interaction, ideally moving anomalies of interest closer to the top. Our main contribution is to formulate this problem within the framework of online convex optimization, which yields an efficient and extremely simple approach to incorporating feedback compared to the prior state-of-the-art. We instantiate this approach for the powerful class of tree-based anomaly detectors and conduct experiments on a range of benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate the utility of incorporating feedback and advantages of our approach over the state-of-the-art. In addition, we present results on a significant cybersecurity application where the goal is to detect red-team attacks in real system audit data. We show that our approach for incorporating feedback is able to significantly reduce the time required to identify malicious system entities across multiple attacks on multiple operating systems.",KDD
Using Information Theory to Improve the Robustness of Trust Systems (Page 791),2015,"Unfair rating attacks to trust systems can affect the accuracy of trust evaluation when trust ratings (recommendations) about trustee agents are sought by truster agents from others (advisor agents). A robust trust system should remain accurate, even under the worst-case attacks which yield the least useful recommendations. In this work, we base on information theory to quantify the utility of recommendations. We analyse models where the advisors have the worst-case behaviour. With these models, we formally prove that if the fraction of dishonest advisors exceeds a certain threshold, recommendations become completely useless (in the worst case). Our evaluations on several popular trust models show that they cannot provide accurate trust evaluation under the worst-case as well as many other types of unfair rating attacks. Our way of explicitly modelling dishonest advisors induces a method of computing trust accurately, which can serve to improve the robustness of the trust models.",AAMAS
Review spam detection via temporal pattern discovery,2012,"Online reviews play a crucial role in today's electronic commerce. It is desirable for a customer to read reviews of products or stores before making the decision of what or from where to buy. Due to the pervasive spam reviews, customers can be misled to buy low-quality products, while decent stores can be defamed by malicious reviews. We observe that, in reality, a great portion (> 90% in the data we study) of the reviewers write only one review (singleton review). These reviews are so enormous in number that they can almost determine a store's rating and impression. However, existing methods did not examine this larger part of the reviews. Are most of these singleton reviews truthful ones? If not, how to detect spam reviews in singleton reviews? We call this problem singleton review spam detection.
 To address this problem, we observe that the normal reviewers' arrival pattern is stable and uncorrelated to their rating pattern temporally. In contrast, spam attacks are usually bursty and either positively or negatively correlated to the rating. Thus, we propose to detect such attacks via unusually correlated temporal patterns. We identify and construct multidimensional time series based on aggregate statistics, in order to depict and mine such correlations. In this way, the singleton review spam detection problem is mapped to a abnormally correlated pattern detection problem. We propose a hierarchical algorithm to robustly detect the time windows where such attacks are likely to have happened. The algorithm also pinpoints such windows in different time resolutions to facilitate faster human inspection. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective in detecting singleton review attacks. We discover that singleton review is a significant source of spam reviews and largely affects the ratings of online stores.",KDD
Spatially embedded co-offence prediction using supervised learning,2014,"Crime reduction and prevention strategies are essential to increase public safety and reduce the crime costs to society. Law enforcement agencies have long realized the importance of analyzing co-offending networks---networks of offenders who have committed crimes together---for this purpose. Although network structure can contribute significantly to co-offence prediction, research in this area is very limited. Here we address this important problem by proposing a framework for co-offence prediction using supervised learning. Considering the available information about offenders, we introduce social, geographic, geo-social and similarity feature sets which are used for classifying potential negative and positive pairs of offenders. Similar to other social networks, co-offending networks also suffer from a highly skewed distribution of positive and negative pairs. To address the class imbalance problem, we identify three types of criminal cooperation opportunities which help to reduce the class imbalance ratio significantly, while keeping half of the co-offences. The proposed framework is evaluated on a large crime dataset for the Province of British Columbia, Canada. Our experimental evaluation of four different feature sets show that the novel geo-social features are the best predictors. Overall, we experimentally show the high effectiveness of the proposed co-offence prediction framework. We believe that our framework will not only allow law enforcement agencies to improve their crime reduction and prevention strategies, but also offers new criminological insights into criminal link formation between offenders.",KDD
Mining for geographically disperse communities in social networks by leveraging distance modularity,2013,"Social networks where the actors occupy geospatial locations are prevalent in military, intelligence, and policing operations such as counter-terrorism, counter-insurgency, and combating organized crime. These networks are often derived from a variety of intelligence sources. The discovery of communities that are geographically disperse stems from the requirement to identify higher-level organizational structures, such as a logistics group that provides support to various geographically disperse terrorist cells. We apply a variant of Newman-Girvan modularity to this problem known as distance modularity. To address the problem of finding geographically disperse communities, we modify the well-known Louvain algorithm to find partitions of networks that provide near-optimal solutions to this quantity. We apply this algorithm to numerous samples from two real-world social networks and a terrorism network data set whose nodes have associated geospatial locations. Our experiments show this to be an effective approach and highlight various practical considerations when applying the algorithm to distance modularity maximization. Several military, intelligence, and law-enforcement organizations are working with us to further test and field software for this emerging application.",KDD
Algorithms for interpretable machine learning,2014,"It is extremely important in many application domains to have transparency in predictive modeling. Domain experts do not tend to prefer ""black box"" predictive model models.

 I will discuss recent work on interpretable predictive modeling with decision lists and sparse integer linear models. I will describe several approaches, including an algorithm based on discrete optimization, and an algorithm based on Bayesian analysis.

Towards Applying Interactive POMDPs to Real-World Adversary Modeling,2010,"We examine the suitability of using decision processes to model real-world systems of intelligent adversaries. Decision processes have long been used to study cooperative multiagent interactions, but their practical applicability to adversarial problems has received minimal study. We address the pros and cons of applying sequential decision-making in this area, using the crime of money laundering as a specific example. Motivated by case studies, we abstract out a model of the money laundering process, using the framework of interactive partially observable Markov decision processes (I-POMDPs). We address why this framework is well suited for modeling adversarial interactions. Particle filtering and value iteration are used to solve the model, with the application of different pruning and look-ahead strategies to assess the tradeoffs between solution quality and algorithmic run time. Our results show that there is a large gap in the level of realism that can currently be achieved by such decision models, largely due to computational demands that limit the size of problems that can be solved. While these results represent solutions to a simplified model of money laundering, they illustrate nonetheless the kinds of agent interactions that cannot be captured by standard approaches such as anomaly detection. This implies that I-POMDP methods may be valuable in the future, when algorithmic capabilities have further evolved.",AAAI
A multi-relational approach to spatial classification,2009,"Spatial classification is the task of learning models to predict class labels based on the features of entities as well as the spatial relationships to other entities and their features. Spatial data can be represented as multi-relational data, however it presents novel challenges not present in multi-relational problems. One such problem is that spatial relationships are embedded in space, unknown a priori, and it is part of the algorithm's task to determine which relationships are important and what properties to consider. In order to determine when two entities are spatially related in an adaptive and non-parametric way, we propose a Voronoi-based neighbourhood definition upon which spatial literals can be built. Properties of these neighbourhoods also need to be described and used for classification purposes. Non-spatial aggregation literals already exist within the multi-relational framework, but are not sufficient for comprehensive spatial classification. A formal set of additions to the multi-relational data mining framework is proposed, to be able to represent spatial aggregations as well as spatial features and literals. These additions allow for capturing more complex interactions and spatial occurrences such as spatial trends. In order to more efficiently perform the rule learning and exploit powerful multi-processor machines, a scalable parallelized method capable of reducing the runtime by several factors is presented. The method is compared against existing methods by experimental evaluation on a real world crime dataset which demonstrate the importance of the neighbourhood definition and the advantages of parallelization.",KDD
Optimal Interdiction of Urban Criminals with the Aid of Real-Time Information,2019,"Most violent crimes happen in urban and suburban cities. With emerging tracking techniques, law enforcement officers can have real-time location information of the escaping criminals and dynamically adjust the security resource allocation to interdict them. Unfortunately, existing work on urban network security games largely ignores such information. This paper addresses this omission. First, we show that ignoring the real-time information can cause an arbitrarily large loss of efficiency. To mitigate this loss, we propose a novel NEtwork purSuiT game (NEST) model that captures the interaction between an escaping adversary and a defender with multiple resources and real-time information available. Second, solving NEST is proven to be NP-hard. Third, after transforming the non-convex program of solving NEST to a linear program, we propose our incremental strategy generation algorithm, including: (i) novel pruning techniques in our best response oracle; and (ii) novel techniques for mapping strategies between subgames and adding multiple best response strategies at one iteration to solve extremely large problems. Finally, extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our approach, which scales up to realistic problem sizes with hundreds of nodes on networks including the real network of Manhattan.",AAAI
Exploiting Data and Human Knowledge for Predicting Wildlife Poaching,2018,"Poaching continues to be a significant threat to the conservation of wildlife and the associated ecosystem. Estimating and predicting where the poachers have committed or would commit crimes is essential to more effective allocation of patrolling resources. The real-world data in this domain is often sparse, noisy and incomplete, consisting of a small number of positive data (poaching signs), a large number of negative data with label uncertainty, and an even larger number of unlabeled data. Fortunately, domain experts such as rangers can provide complementary information about poaching activity patterns. However, this kind of human knowledge has rarely been used in previous approaches. In this paper, we contribute new solutions to the predictive analysis of poaching patterns by exploiting both very limited data and human knowledge. We propose an approach to elicit quantitative information from domain experts through a questionnaire built upon a clustering-based division of the conservation area. In addition, we propose algorithms that exploit qualitative and quantitative information provided by the domain experts to augment the dataset and improve learning. In collaboration with World Wild Fund for Nature, we show that incorporating human knowledge leads to better predictions in a conservation area in Northeastern China where the charismatic species is Siberian Tiger. The results show the importance of exploiting human knowledge when learning from limited data.",COMPASS
Optimal Escape Interdiction on Transportation Networks,2017,"Preventing crimes or terrorist attacks in urban areas is challenging. Law enforcement officers need to respond quickly to catch the attacker on his escape route, which is subject to time-dependent traffic conditions on transportation networks. The attacker can strategically choose his escape path and driving speed to avoid being captured. Existing work on security resource allocation has not considered such scenarios with time-dependent strategies for both players. Therefore, in this paper, we study the problem of efficiently scheduling security resources for interdicting the escaping attacker. We propose: 1) a new defender-attacker security game model for escape interdiction on transportation networks; and 2) an efficient double oracle algorithm to compute the optimal defender strategy, which combines mixed-integer linear programming formulations for best response problems and effective approximation algorithms for improving the scalability of the algorithms. Experimental evaluation shows that our approach significantly outperforms baselines in solution quality and scales up to realistic-sized transportation networks with hundreds of intersections.",IJCAI
Exploiting geographic dependencies for real estate appraisal: a mutual perspective of ranking and clustering,2014,"It is traditionally a challenge for home buyers to understand, compare and contrast the investment values of real estates. While a number of estate appraisal methods have been developed to value real property, the performances of these methods have been limited by the traditional data sources for estate appraisal. However, with the development of new ways of collecting estate-related mobile data, there is a potential to leverage geographic dependencies of estates for enhancing estate appraisal. Indeed, the geographic dependencies of the value of an estate can be from the characteristics of its own neighborhood (individual), the values of its nearby estates (peer), and the prosperity of the affiliated latent business area (zone). To this end, in this paper, we propose a geographic method, named ClusRanking, for estate appraisal by leveraging the mutual enforcement of ranking and clustering power. ClusRanking is able to exploit geographic individual, peer, and zone dependencies in a probabilistic ranking model. Specifically, we first extract the geographic utility of estates from geography data, estimate the neighborhood popularity of estates by mining taxicab trajectory data, and model the influence of latent business areas via ClusRanking. Also, we use a linear model to fuse these three influential factors and predict estate investment values. Moreover, we simultaneously consider individual, peer and zone dependencies, and derive an estate-specific ranking likelihood as the objective function. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation with real-world estate related data, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",KDD
When Security Games Hit Traffic: Optimal Traffic Enforcement Under One Sided Uncertainty,2017,"Efficient traffic enforcement is an essential, yet complex, component in preventing road accidents. In this paper, we present a novel model and an optimizing algorithm for mitigating some of the computational challenges of real-world traffic enforcement allocation in large road networks. Our approach allows for scalable, coupled and non-Markovian optimization of multiple police units and guarantees optimality. In an extensive empirical evaluation we show that our approach favorably compares to several baseline solutions achieving a significant speed-up, using both synthetic and real-world road networks.",IJCAI
Adversarial support vector machine learning,2012,"Many learning tasks such as spam filtering and credit card fraud detection face an active adversary that tries to avoid detection. For learning problems that deal with an active adversary, it is important to model the adversary's attack strategy and develop robust learning models to mitigate the attack. These are the two objectives of this paper. We consider two attack models: a free-range attack model that permits arbitrary data corruption and a restrained attack model that anticipates more realistic attacks that a reasonable adversary would devise under penalties. We then develop optimal SVM learning strategies against the two attack models. The learning algorithms minimize the hinge loss while assuming the adversary is modifying data to maximize the loss. Experiments are performed on both artificial and real data sets. We demonstrate that optimal solutions may be overly pessimistic when the actual attacks are much weaker than expected. More important, we demonstrate that it is possible to develop a much more resilient SVM learning model while making loose assumptions on the data corruption models. When derived under the restrained attack model, our optimal SVM learning strategy provides more robust overall performance under a wide range of attack parameters.",KDD
"Graph Analysis for Detecting Fraud, Waste, and Abuse in Healthcare Data",2015,"Detection of fraud, waste, and abuse (FWA) is an important yet difficult problem. In this paper, we describe a system to detect suspicious activities in large healthcare claims datasets. Each healthcare dataset is viewed as a heterogeneous network of patients, doctors, pharmacies, and other entities. These networks can be large, with millions of patients, hundreds of thousands of doctors, and tens of thousands of pharmacies, for example. Graph analysis techniques are developed to find suspicious individuals, suspicious relationships between individuals, unusual changes over time, unusual geospatial dispersion, and anomalous networks within the overall graph structure. The system has been deployed on multiple sites and data sets, both government and commercial, to facilitate the work of FWA investigation analysts.",AAAI
Big Data System for Analyzing Risky Procurement Entities,2015,"An accredited biennial 2014 study by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners claims that on average 5% of a company's revenue is lost because of unchecked fraud every year. The reason for such heavy losses are that it takes around 18 months for a fraud to be caught and audits catch only 3% of the actual fraud. This begs the need for better tools and processes to be able to quickly and cheaply identify potential malefactors. In this paper, we describe a robust tool to identify procurement related fraud/risk, though the general design and the analytical components could be adapted to detecting fraud in other domains. Besides analyzing standard transactional data, our solution analyzes multiple public and private data sources leading to wider coverage of fraud types than what generally exists in the marketplace. Moreover, our approach is more principled in the sense that the learning component, which is based on investigation feedback has formal guarantees. Though such a tool is ever evolving, a deployment of this tool over the past 12 months has found many interesting cases from compliance risk and fraud point of view across more than 150 countries and 65000+ vendors, increasing the number of true positives found by over 80\% compared with other state-of-the-art tools that the domain experts were previously using.",KDD
Interactive learning for efficiently detecting errors in insurance claims,2011,"Many practical data mining systems such as those for fraud detection and surveillance deal with building classifiers that are not autonomous but part of a larger interactive system with an expert in the loop. The goal of these systems is not just to maximize the performance of the classifier but to make the experts more efficient at performing their task, thus maximizing the overall Return on Investment of the system. This paper describes an interactive system for detecting payment errors in insurance claims with claim auditors in the loop. We describe an interactive claims prioritization component that uses an online cost-sensitive learning approach (more-like-this) to make the system efficient. Our interactive prioritization component is built on top of a batch classifier that has been trained to detect payment errors in health insurance claims and optimizes the interaction between the classifier and the domain experts who are consuming the results of this system. The goal is to make these auditors more efficient and effective as well as improving the classification performance of the system. The result is both a reduction in time it takes for the auditors to review and label claims as well as improving the precision of the system in finding payment errors. We show results obtained from applying this system at two major US health insurance companies indicating significant reduction in claim audit costs and potential savings of $20-$26 million/year making the insurance providers more efficient and lowering their operating costs. Our system reduces the money being wasted by providers and insurers dealing with incorrectly processed claims and makes the healthcare system more efficient.",KDD
Fast nearest-neighbor search in disk-resident graphs,2010,"Link prediction, personalized graph search, fraud detection, and many such graph mining problems revolve around the computation of the most ""similar"" k nodes to a given query node. One widely used class of similarity measures is based on random walks on graphs, e.g., personalized pagerank, hitting and commute times, and simrank. There are two fundamental problems associated with these measures. First, existing online algorithms typically examine the local neighborhood of the query node which can become significantly slower whenever high-degree nodes are encountered (a common phenomenon in real-world graphs). We prove that turning high degree nodes into sinks results in only a small approximation error, while greatly improving running times. The second problem is that of computing similarities at query time when the graph is too large to be memory-resident. The obvious solution is to split the graph into clusters of nodes and store each cluster on a disk page; ideally random walks will rarely cross cluster boundaries and cause page-faults. Our contributions here are twofold: (a) we present an efficient deterministic algorithm to find the k closest neighbors (in terms of personalized pagerank) of any query node in such a clustered graph, and (b) we develop a clustering algorithm (RWDISK) that uses only sequential sweeps over data files. Empirical results on several large publicly available graphs like DBLP, Citeseer and Live-Journal (~ 90 M edges) demonstrate that turning high degree nodes into sinks not only improves running time of RWDISK by a factor of 3 but also boosts link prediction accuracy by a factor of 4 on average. We also show that RWDISK returns more desirable (high conductance and small size) clusters than the popular clustering algorithm METIS, while requiring much less memory. Finally our deterministic algorithm for computing nearest neighbors incurs far fewer page-faults (factor of 5) than actually simulating random walks.",KDD
Using co-visitation networks for detecting large scale online display advertising exchange fraud,2013,"Data generated by observing the actions of web browsers across the internet is being used at an ever increasing rate for both building models and making decisions. In fact, a quarter of the industry-track papers for KDD in 2012 were based on data generated by online actions. The models, analytics and decisions they inform all stem from the assumption that observed data captures the intent of users. However, a large portion of these observed actions are not intentional, and are effectively polluting the models. Much of this observed activity is either generated by robots traversing the internet or the result of unintended actions of real users. These non-intentional actions observed in the web logs severely bias both analytics and the models created from the data. In this paper, we will show examples of how non-intentional traffic that is produced by fraudulent activities adversely affects both general analytics and predictive models, and propose an approach using co-visitation networks to identify sites that have large amounts of this fraudulent traffic. We will then show how this approach, along with a second stage classifier that identifies non-intentional traffic at the browser level, is deployed in production at Media6Degrees (m6d), a targeting technology company for display advertising. This deployed product acts both to filter out the fraudulent traffic from the input data and to insure that we don't serve ads during unintended website visits.",KDD
Discovering Temporal Patterns from Insurance Interaction Data,2019,"In the insurance industry, timely and effective interaction with customers are at the core of everyday operations and processes that are key for a satisfactory customer experience. These interactions often result in sequences of data derived from events that occur over time. Such recurrent patterns can provide valuable information that can be used in a variety of ways to improve customer related work-flows. In this paper we demonstrate the application of a recently proposed algorithm to uncover such time patterns that takes into account the time between events to form such patterns. We use temporal customer data generated from two different use-cases (satisfaction and fraud) to show that this algorithm successfully detects patterns that occur in the insurance context.",AAAI
Learning to combine discriminative classifiers: confidence based,2010,"Much of research in data mining and machine learning has led to numerous practical applications. Spam filtering, fraud detection, and user query-intent analysis has relied heavily on machine learned classifiers, and resulted in improvements in robust classification accuracy. Combining multiple classifiers (a.k.a. Ensemble Learning) is a well studied and has been known to improve effectiveness of a classifier. To address two key challenges in Ensemble Learning-- (1) learning weights of individual classifiers and (2) the combination rule of their weighted responses, this paper proposes a novel Ensemble classifier, EnLR, that computes weights of responses from discriminative classifiers and combines their weighted responses to produce a single response for a test instance. The combination rule is based on aggregating weighted responses, where a weight of an individual classifier is inversely based on their respective variances around their responses. Here, variance quantifies the uncertainty of the discriminative classifiers' parameters, which in turn depends on the training samples. As opposed to other ensemble methods where the weight of each individual classifier is learned as a part of parameter learning and thus the same weight is applied to all testing instances, our model is actively adjusted as individual classifiers become confident at its decision for a test instance. Our empirical experiments on various data sets demonstrate that our combined classifier produces ""effective"" results when compared with a single classifier. Our novel classifier shows statistically significant better accuracy when compared to well known Ensemble methods -- Bagging and AdaBoost. In addition to robust accuracy, our model is extremely efficient dealing with high volumes of training samples due to the independent learning paradigm among its multiple classifiers. It is simple to implement in a distributed computing environment such as Hadoop.",KDD
FAST: a roc-based feature selection metric for small samples and imbalanced data classification problems,2008,"The class imbalance problem is encountered in a large number of practical applications of machine learning and data mining, for example, information retrieval and filtering, and the detection of credit card fraud. It has been widely realized that this imbalance raises issues that are either nonexistent or less severe compared to balanced class cases and often results in a classifier's suboptimal performance. This is even more true when the imbalanced data are also high dimensional. In such cases, feature selection methods are critical to achieve optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a new feature selection method, Feature Assessment by Sliding Thresholds (FAST), which is based on the area under a ROC curve generated by moving the decision boundary of a single feature classifier with thresholds placed using an even-bin distribution. FAST is compared to two commonly-used feature selection methods, correlation coefficient and RELevance In Estimating Features (RELIEF), for imbalanced data classification. The experimental results obtained on text mining, mass spectrometry, and microarray data sets showed that the proposed method outperformed both RELIEF and correlation methods on skewed data sets and was comparable on balanced data sets; when small number of features is preferred, the classification performance of the proposed method was significantly improved compared to correlation and RELIEF-based methods.",KDD

Online Reputation Fraud Campaign Detection in User Ratings,2017,"Reputation fraud campaigns (RFCs) distort the reputations of rated items, by generating fake ratings through multiple spammers. One effective way of detecting RFCs is to characterize their collective behaviors based on rating histories.However, these campaigns are constantly evolving and changing tactics to evade detection.For example, they can launch early attacks on the items to quickly dominate the reputations.They can also whitewash themselves through creating new accounts for subsequent attacks.It is thus challenging for existing approaches working on historical data to promptly react to such emerging fraud activities.In this paper, we conduct RFC detection in online fashion, so as to spot campaign activities as early as possible.This leads to a unified and scalable optimization framework, FraudScan, that can adapt to emerging fraud patterns over time.Empirical analysis on two real-world datasets validates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.",IJCAI
SAFE: A Neural Survival Analysis Model for Fraud Early Detection,2019,"Many online platforms have deployed anti-fraud systems to detect and prevent fraudulent activities. However, there is usually a gap between the time that a user commits a fraudulent action and the time that the user is suspended by the platform. How to detect fraudsters in time is a challenging problem. Most of the existing approaches adopt classifiers to predict fraudsters given their activity sequences along time. The main drawback of classification models is that the prediction results between consecutive timestamps are often inconsistent. In this paper, we propose a survival analysis based fraud early detection model, SAFE, which maps dynamic user activities to survival probabilities that are guaranteed to be monotonically decreasing along time. SAFE adopts recurrent neural network (RNN) to handle user activity sequences and directly outputs hazard values at each timestamp, and then, survival probability derived from hazard values is deployed to achieve consistent predictions. Because we only observe the user suspended time instead of the fraudulent activity time in the training data, we revise the loss function of the regular survival model to achieve fraud early detection. Experimental results on two real world datasets demonstrate that SAFE outperforms both the survival analysis model and recurrent neural network model alone as well as state-of-theart fraud early detection approaches.",AAAI
FrauDetector: A Graph-Mining-based Framework for Fraudulent Phone Call Detection,2015,"In recent years, fraud is increasing rapidly with the development of modern technology and global communication. Although many literatures have addressed the fraud detection problem, these existing works focus only on formulating the fraud detection problem as a binary classification problem. Due to limitation of information provided by telecommunication records, such classifier-based approaches for fraudulent phone call detection normally do not work well. In this paper, we develop a graph-mining-based fraudulent phone call detection framework for a mobile application to automatically annotate fraudulent phone numbers with a ""fraud"" tag, which is a crucial prerequisite for distinguishing fraudulent phone calls from normal phone calls. Our detection approach performs a weighted HITS algorithm to learn the trust value of a remote phone number. Based on telecommunication records, we build two kinds of directed bipartite graph: i) CPG and ii) UPG to represent telecommunication behavior of users. To weight the edges of CPG and UPG, we extract features for each pair of user and remote phone number in two different yet complementary aspects: 1) duration relatedness (DR) between user and phone number; and 2) frequency relatedness (FR) between user and phone number. Upon weighted CPG and UPG, we determine a trust value for each remote phone number. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive experimental study based on a dataset collected through an anti-fraud mobile application, Whoscall. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our weighted HITS-based approach and show the strength of taking both DR and FR into account in feature extraction.",KDD
Tax Fraud Detection for Under-Reporting Declarations Using an Unsupervised Machine Learning Approach,2018,"Tax fraud is the intentional act of lying on a tax return form with intent to lower one's tax liability. Under-reporting is one of the most common types of tax fraud, it consists in filling a tax return form with a lesser tax base. As a result of this act, fiscal revenues are reduced, undermining public investment.
 Detecting tax fraud is one of the main priorities of local tax authorities which are required to develop cost-efficient strategies to tackle this problem. Most of the recent works in tax fraud detection are based on supervised machine learning techniques that make use of labeled or audit-assisted data. Regrettably, auditing tax declarations is a slow and costly process, therefore access to labeled historical information is extremely limited. For this reason, the applicability of supervised machine learning techniques for tax fraud detection is severely hindered.
 Such limitations motivate the contribution of this work. We present a novel approach for the detection of potential fraudulent tax payers using only unsupervised learning techniques and allowing the future use of supervised learning techniques. We demonstrate the ability of our model to identify under-reporting taxpayers on real tax payment declarations, reducing the number of potential fraudulent tax payers to audit. The obtained results demonstrate that our model doesn't miss on marking declarations as suspicious and labels previously undetected tax declarations as suspicious, increasing the operational efficiency in the tax supervision process without needing historic labeled data.",KDD
Corporate residence fraud detection,2014,"With the globalisation of the world's economies and ever-evolving financial structures, fraud has become one of the main dissipaters of government wealth and perhaps even a major contributor in the slowing down of economies in general. Although corporate residence fraud is known to be a major factor, data availability and high sensitivity have caused this domain to be largely untouched by academia. The current Belgian government has pledged to tackle this issue at large by using a variety of in-house approaches and cooperations with institutions such as academia, the ultimate goal being a fair and efficient taxation system. This is the first data mining application specifically aimed at finding corporate residence fraud, where we show the predictive value of using both structured and fine-grained invoicing data. We further describe the problems involved in building such a fraud detection system, which are mainly data-related (e.g. data asymmetry, quality, volume, variety and velocity) and deployment-related (e.g. the need for explanations of the predictions made).",KDD
Cash-Out User Detection Based on Attributed Heterogeneous Information Network with a Hierarchical Attention Mechanism,2019,"As one of the major frauds in financial services, cash-out fraud is that users pursue cash gains with illegal or insincere means. Conventional solutions for the cash-out user detection are to perform subtle feature engineering for each user and then apply a classifier, such as GDBT and Neural Network. However, users in financial services have rich interaction relations, which are seldom fully exploited by conventional solutions. In this paper, with the real datasets in Ant Credit Pay of Ant Financial Services Group, we first study the cashout user detection problem and propose a novel hierarchical attention mechanism based cash-out user detection model, called HACUD. Specifically, we model different types of objects and their rich attributes and interaction relations in the scenario of credit payment service with an Attributed Heterogeneous Information Network (AHIN). The HACUD model enhances feature representation of objects through meta-path based neighbors exploiting different aspects of structure information in AHIN. Furthermore, a hierarchical attention mechanism is elaborately designed to model userÃ¢â¬â¢s preferences towards attributes and meta-paths. Experimental results on two real datasets show that the HACUD outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",AAAI
Automated Categorization of Onion Sites for Analyzing the Darkweb Ecosystem,2017,"Onion sites on the darkweb operate using the Tor Hidden Service (HS) protocol to shield their locations on the Internet, which (among other features) enables these sites to host malicious and illegal content while being resistant to legal action and seizure. Identifying and monitoring such illicit sites in the darkweb is of high relevance to the Computer Security and Law Enforcement communities. We have developed an automated infrastructure that crawls and indexes content from onion sites into a large-scale data repository, called LIGHTS, with over 100M pages. In this paper we describe Automated Tool for Onion Labeling (ATOL), a novel scalable analysis service developed to conduct a thematic assessment of the content of onion sites in the LIGHTS repository. ATOL has three core components -- (a) a novel keyword discovery mechanism (ATOLKeyword) which extends analyst-provided keywords for different categories by suggesting new descriptive and discriminative keywords that are relevant for the categories; (b) a classification framework (ATOLClassify) that uses the discovered keywords to map onion site content to a set of categories when sufficient labeled data is available; (c) a clustering framework (ATOLCluster) that can leverage information from multiple external heterogeneous knowledge sources, ranging from domain expertise to Bitcoin transaction data, to categorize onion content in the absence of sufficient supervised data. The paper presents empirical results of ATOL on onion datasets derived from the LIGHTS repository, and additionally benchmarks ATOL's algorithms on the publicly available 20 Newsgroups dataset to demonstrate the reproducibility of its results. On the LIGHTS dataset, ATOLClassify gives a 12% performance gain over an analyst-provided baseline, while ATOLCluster gives a 7% improvement over state-of-the-art semi-supervised clustering algorithms. We also discuss how ATOL has been deployed and externally evaluated, as part of the LIGHTS system.",KDD
Leveraging Crowdsourcing to Detect Improper Tasks in Crowdsourcing Marketplaces,2013,"Controlling the quality of tasks is a major challenge in crowdsourcing marketplaces. Most of the existing crowdsourcing services prohibit requesters from posting illegal or objectionable tasks. Operators in the marketplaces have to monitor the tasks continuously to find such improper tasks; however, it is too expensive to manually investigate each task. In this paper, we present the reports of our trial study on automatic detection of improper tasks to support the monitoring of activities by marketplace operators. We perform experiments using real task data from a commercial crowdsourcing marketplace and show that the classifier trained by the operator judgments achieves high accuracy in detecting improper tasks. In addition, to reduce the annotation costs of the operator and improve the classification accuracy, we consider the use of crowdsourcing for task annotation. We hire a group of crowdsourcing (non-expert) workers to monitor posted tasks, and incorporate their judgments into the training data of the classifier. By applying quality control techniques to handle the variability in worker reliability, our results show that the use of non-expert judgments by crowdsourcing workers in combination with expert judgments improves the accuracy of detecting improper crowdsourcing tasks.",AAAI
Robust Protection of Fisheries with COmPASS,2014,"Fish stocks around the world are in danger from ille- gal fishing. In collaboration with the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), we work to defend fisheries from illegal fish- erman (henceforth called Lanchas) in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We have developed the COmPASS (Conserva- tive Online Patrol ASSistant) system to design USCG patrols against the Lanchas. In this application, we face a population of Lanchas with heterogeneous behavior who fish frequently. We have some data about these Lanchas, but not enough to fit a statistical model. Previ- ous security patrol assistants have focused on counter- terrorism in one-shot games where adversaries are as- sumed to be perfectly rational, and much less data about their behavior is available. COmPASS is novel because: (i) it emphasizes environmental crime; (ii) it is based on a repeated Stackelberg game; (iii) it allows for bounded rationality of the Lanchas and it offers a robust approach against the heterogeneity of the Lancha population; and (iv) it can learn from sparse Lancha data. We report the effectiveness of COmPASS in the Gulf in our numeri- cal experiments based on real fish data. The COmPASS system is to be tested by USCG.",AAAI
Optimal Interdiction of Illegal Network Flow,2016,"Large scale smuggling of illegal goods is a long-standing problem, with $1.4b and thousands of agents assigned to protect the borders from such activity in the US-Mexico border alone. Illegal smuggling activities are usually blocked via inspection stations or ad-hoc checkpoints/roadblocks. Security resources are insufficient to man all stations at all times; furthermore, smugglers regularly conduct surveillance activities.This paper makes several contributions toward the challenging task of optimally interdicting an illegal network flow: i) A new Stackelberg game model for network flow interdiction; ii) A novel Column and Constraint Generation approach for computing the optimal defender strategy; iii) Complexity analysis of the column generation subproblem; iv) Compact convex nonlinear programs for solving the subproblems; v) Novel greedy and heuristic approaches for subproblems with good approximation guarantee.

Knock it off: profiling the online storefronts of counterfeit merchandise,2014,"We describe an automated system for the large-scale monitoring of Web sites that serve as online storefronts for spam-advertised goods. Our system is developed from an extensive crawl of black-market Web sites that deal in illegal pharmaceuticals, replica luxury goods, and counterfeit software. The operational goal of the system is to identify the affiliate programs of online merchants behind these Web sites; the system itself is part of a larger effort to improve the tracking and targeting of these affiliate programs. There are two main challenges in this domain. The first is that appearances can be deceiving: Web pages that render very differently are often linked to the same affiliate program of merchants. The second is the difficulty of acquiring training data: the manual labeling of Web pages, though necessary to some degree, is a laborious and time-consuming process. Our approach in this paper is to extract features that reveal when Web pages linked to the same affiliate program share a similar underlying structure. Using these features, which are mined from a small initial seed of labeled data, we are able to profile the Web sites of forty-four distinct affiliate programs that account, collectively, for hundreds of millions of dollars in illicit e-commerce. Our work also highlights several broad challenges that arise in the large-scale, empirical study of malicious activity on the Web.",KDD
Forecasting Fine-Grained Air Quality Based on Big Data,2015,"In this paper, we forecast the reading of an air quality monitoring station over the next 48 hours, using a data-driven method that considers current meteorological data, weather forecasts, and air quality data of the station and that of other stations within a few hundred kilometers. Our predictive model is comprised of four major components: 1) a linear regression-based temporal predictor to model the local factors of air quality, 2) a neural network-based spatial predictor to model global factors, 3) a dynamic aggregator combining the predictions of the spatial and temporal predictors according to meteorological data, and 4) an inflection predictor to capture sudden changes in air quality. We evaluate our model with data from 43 cities in China, surpassing the results of multiple baseline methods. We have deployed a system with the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection, providing 48-hour fine-grained air quality forecasts for four major Chinese cities every hour. The forecast function is also enabled on Microsoft Bing Map and MS cloud platform Azure. Our technology is general and can be applied globally for other cities.",KDD
Finding Precursors to Anomalous Drop in Airspeed During a Flight's Takeoff,2017,"Aerodynamic stall based loss of control in flight is a major cause of fatal flight accidents. In a typical takeoff, a flight's airspeed continues to increase as it gains altitude. However, in some cases, the airspeed may drop immediately after takeoff and when left uncorrected, the flight gets close to a stall condition which is extremely risky. The takeoff is a high workload period for the flight crew involving frequent monitoring, control and communication with the ground control tower. Although there exists secondary safety systems and specialized recovery maneuvers, current technology is reactive; often based on simple threshold detection and does not provide the crew with sufficient lead time. Further, with increasing complexity of automation, the crew may not be aware of the true states of the automation to take corrective actions in time. At NASA, we aim to develop decision support tools by mining historic flight data to proactively identify and manage high risk situations encountered in flight. In this paper, we present our work on finding precursors to the anomalous drop-in-airspeed (ADA) event using the ADOPT (Automatic Discovery of Precursors in Time series) algorithm. ADOPT works by converting the precursor discovery problem into a search for sub-optimal decision making in the time series data, which is modeled using reinforcement learning. We give insights about the flight data, feature selection, ADOPT modeling and results on precursor discovery. Some improvements to ADOPT algorithm are implemented that reduces its computational complexity and enables forecasting of the adverse event. Using ADOPT analysis, we have identified some interesting precursor patterns that were validated to be operationally significant by subject matter experts. The performance of ADOPT is evaluated by using the precursor scores as features to predict the drop in airspeed events.",KDD
Influence-Driven Model for Time Series Prediction from Partial Observations,2015,"Applications in sustainability domains such as in energy, transportation, and natural resource and environment monitoring, increasingly use sensors for collecting data and sending it back to centrally located processing nodes. While data can usually be collected by the sensors at a very high speed, in many cases, it can not be sent back to central nodes at a frequency that is required for fast and real-time modeling and decision-making. This may be due to physical limitations of the transmission networks, or due to consumers limiting frequent transmission of data from sensors located at their premises for security and privacy concerns. We propose a novel solution to the problem of making short term predictions in absence of real-time data from sensors. A key implication of our work is that by using real-time data from only a small subset of influential sensors, we are able to make predictions for all sen- sors. We evaluated our approach with a large real-world electricity consumption data collected from smart meters in Los Angeles and the results show that between prediction horizons of 2 to 8 hours, despite lack of real time data, our influence model outperforms the baseline model that uses real-time data. Also, when using partial real-time data from only Ã¢â°Ë 7% influential smart meters, we witness prediction error increase by only Ã¢â°Ë 0.5% over the baseline, thus demonstrating the usefulness of our method for practical scenarios.",AAAI
Ranking Causal Anomalies via Temporal and Dynamical Analysis on Vanishing Correlations,2016,"Modern world has witnessed a dramatic increase in our ability to collect, transmit and distribute real-time monitoring and surveillance data from large-scale information systems and cyber-physical systems. Detecting system anomalies thus attracts significant amount of interest in many fields such as security, fault management, and industrial optimization. Recently, invariant network has shown to be a powerful way in characterizing complex system behaviours. In the invariant network, a node represents a system component and an edge indicates a stable, significant interaction between two components. Structures and evolutions of the invariance network, in particular the vanishing correlations, can shed important light on locating causal anomalies and performing diagnosis. However, existing approaches to detect causal anomalies with the invariant network often use the percentage of vanishing correlations to rank possible casual components, which have several limitations: 1) fault propagation in the network is ignored; 2) the root casual anomalies may not always be the nodes with a high-percentage of vanishing correlations; 3) temporal patterns of vanishing correlations are not exploited for robust detection. To address these limitations, in this paper we propose a network diffusion based framework to identify significant causal anomalies and rank them. Our approach can effectively model fault propagation over the entire invariant network, and can perform joint inference on both the structural, and the time-evolving broken invariance patterns. As a result, it can locate high-confidence anomalies that are truly responsible for the vanishing correlations, and can compensate for unstructured measurement noise in the system. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets, bank information system datasets, and coal plant cyber-physical system datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",KDD
GELL: Automatic Extraction of Epidemiological Line Lists from Open Sources,2017,"Real-time monitoring and responses to emerging public health threats rely on the availability of timely surveillance data. During the early stages of an epidemic, the ready availability of line lists with detailed tabular information about laboratory-confirmed cases can assist epidemiologists in making reliable inferences and forecasts. Such inferences are crucial to understand the epidemiology of a specific disease early enough to stop or control the outbreak. However, construction of such line lists requires considerable human supervision and therefore, difficult to generate in real-time. In this paper, we motivate Guided Epidemiological Line List (GELL), the first tool for building automated line lists (in near real-time) from open source reports of emerging disease outbreaks. Specifically, we focus on deriving epidemiological characteristics of an emerging disease and the affected population from reports of illness. GELL uses distributed vector representations (ala word2vec) to discover a set of indicators for each line list feature. This discovery of indicators is followed by the use of dependency parsing based techniques for final extraction in tabular form. We evaluate the performance of GELL against a human annotated line list provided by HealthMap corresponding to MERS outbreaks in Saudi Arabia. We demonstrate that GELL extracts line list features with increased accuracy compared to a baseline method. We further show how these automatically extracted line list features can be used for making epidemiological inferences, such as inferring demographics and symptoms-to-hospitalization period of affected individuals.",KDD
Learning Hybrid Models with Guarded Transitions,2015,"Innovative methods have been developed for diagnosis, activity monitoring, and state estimation that achieve high accuracy through the use of stochastic models involving hybrid discrete and continuous behaviors. A key bottleneck is the automated acquisition of these hybrid models, and recent methods have focused predominantly on Jump Markov processes and piecewise autoregressive models. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm capable of performing unsupervised learning of guarded Probabilistic Hybrid Automata (PHA) models, which extends prior work by allowing stochastic discrete mode transitions in a hybrid system to have a functional dependence on its continuous state. Our experiments indicate that guarded PHA models can yield significant performance improvements when used by hybrid state estimators, particularly when diagnosing the true discrete mode of the system, without any noticeable impact on their real-time performance.",AAAI
Efficient Long-Term Degradation Profiling in Time Series for Complex Physical Systems,2015,"The long term operation of physical systems inevitably leads to their wearing out, and may cause degradations in performance or the unexpected failure of the entire system. To reduce the possibility of such unanticipated failures, the system must be monitored for tell-tale symptoms of degradation that are suggestive of imminent failure. In this work, we introduce a novel time series analysis technique that allows the decomposition of the time series into trend and fluctuation components, providing the monitoring software with actionable information about the changes of the system's behavior over time. We analyze the underlying problem and formulate it to a Quadratic Programming (QP) problem that can be solved with existing QP-solvers. However, when the profiling resolution is high, as generally required by real-world applications, such a decomposition becomes intractable to general QP-solvers. To speed up the problem solving, we further transform the problem and present a novel QP formulation, Non-negative QP, for the problem and demonstrate a tractable solution that bypasses the use of slow general QP-solvers. We demonstrate our ideas on both synthetic and real datasets, showing that our method allows us to accurately extract the degradation phenomenon of time series. We further demonstrate the generality of our ideas by applying them beyond classic machine prognostics to problems in identifying the influence of news events on currency exchange rates and stock prices. We fully implement our profiling system and deploy it into several physical systems, such as chemical plants and nuclear power plants, and it greatly helps detect the degradation phenomenon, and diagnose the corresponding components.",KDD
TIMERS: Error-Bounded SVD Restart on Dynamic Networks,2018,"Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a popular approach in various network applications, such as link prediction and network parameter characterization. Incremental SVD approaches are proposed to process newly changed nodes and edges in dynamic networks. However, incremental SVD approaches suffer from serious error accumulation inevitably due to approximation on incremental updates. SVD restart is an effective approach to reset the aggregated error, but when to restart SVD for dynamic networks is not addressed in literature. In this paper, we propose TIMERS, Theoretically Instructed Maximum-Error-bounded Restart of SVD, a novel approach which optimally sets the restart time in order to reduce error accumulation in time. Specifically, we monitor the margin between reconstruction loss of incremental updates and the minimum loss in SVD model. To reduce the complexity of monitoring, we theoretically develop a lower bound of SVD minimum loss for dynamic networks and use the bound to replace the minimum loss in monitoring. By setting a maximum tolerated error as a threshold, we can trigger SVD restart automatically when the margin exceeds this threshold. We prove that the time complexity of our method is linear with respect to the number of local dynamic changes, and our method is general across different types of dynamic networks. We conduct extensive experiments on several synthetic and real dynamic networks. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the existing methods by reducing 27% to 42% in terms of the maximum error for dynamic network reconstruction when fixing the number of restarts. Our method reduces the number of restarts by 25% to 50% when fixing the maximum error tolerated.",AAAI
On the Balance of Meter Deployment Cost and NILM Accuracy,2015,"Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) uses one smart meter at the power feed to disaggregate the states of a set of appliances. Multiple NILM meters are deployed to achieve high monitoring accuracy in large-scale power systems. Our work studies the tradeoff between monitoring accuracy and meter deployment, in a quantitative and extensible way. In particular, we introduce a clearness function as an abstract indicator of expected monitoring accuracy given any NILM method, and then showcase two concrete constructions. With the notation of a clearness function, we propose solutions to the smart meter deployment problem (SMDP), that is, the problem of finding a deployment scheme with minimum number of meters while attaining a required monitoring accuracy. Theoretically, SMDP is shown NP-hard and a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) is proposed in this paper. For evaluation, we show that our proposed scheme is efficient and effective in terms of approximation ratio and running time. On real and simulated datasets, our proposed framework achieves a higher monitoring accuracy at a much lower cost, outperforming common baseline algorithms.",IJCAI
TRUSTS: Scheduling Randomized Patrols for Fare Inspection in Transit Systems,2012,"In proof-of-payment transit systems, passengers are legally required to purchase tickets before entering but are not physically forced to do so. Instead, patrol units move about the transit system, inspecting the tickets of passengers, who face fines if caught fare evading. The deterrence of such fines depends on the unpredictability and effectiveness of the patrols. In this paper, we present TRUSTS, an application for scheduling randomized patrols for fare inspection in transit systems. TRUSTS models the problem of computing patrol strategies as a leader-follower Stackelberg game where the objective is to deter fare evasion and hence maximize revenue. This problem differs from previously studied Stackelberg settings in that the leader strategies must satisfy massive temporal and spatial constraints; moreover, unlike in these counterterrorism-motivated Stackelberg applications, a large fraction of the ridership might realistically consider fare evasion, and so the number of followers is potentially huge. A third key novelty in our work is deliberate simplification of leader strategies to make patrols easier to be executed. We present an efficient algorithm for computing such patrol strategies and present experimental results using real-world ridership data from the Los Angeles Metro Rail system. The Los Angeles County SheriffÃ¢â¬â¢s department has begun trials of TRUSTS.",AAAI
Deep Reinforcement Learning for Green Security Games with Real-Time Information,2019,"Green Security Games (GSGs) have been proposed and applied to optimize patrols conducted by law enforcement agencies in green security domains such as combating poaching, illegal logging and overfishing. However, real-time information such as footprints and agentsÃ¢â¬â¢ subsequent actions upon receiving the information, e.g., rangers following the footprints to chase the poacher, have been neglected in previous work. To fill the gap, we first propose a new game model GSG-I which augments GSGs with sequential movement and the vital element of real-time information. Second, we design a novel deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm, DeDOL, to compute a patrolling strategy that adapts to the real-time information against a best-responding attacker. DeDOL is built upon the double oracle framework and the policy-space response oracle, solving a restricted game and iteratively adding best response strategies to it through training deep Q-networks. Exploring the game structure, DeDOL uses domain-specific heuristic strategies as initial strategies and constructs several local modes for efficient and parallelized training. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use Deep Q-Learning for security games.",AAAI
Patrol Strategies to Maximize Pristine Forest Area,2012,"Illegal extraction of forest resources is fought, in many developing countries, by patrols that try to make this activity less profitable, using the threat of confiscation. With a limited budget, officials will try to distribute the patrols throughout the forest intelligently, in order to most effectively limit extraction. Prior work in forest economics has formalized this as a Stackelberg game, one very different in character from the discrete Stackelberg problem settings previously studied in the multiagent literature. Specifically, the leader wishes to minimize the distance by which a profit-maximizing extractor will trespass into the forest---or to maximize the radius of the remaining ``pristine'' forest area. The follower's cost-benefit analysis of potential trespass distances is affected by the likelihood of being caught and suffering confiscation. In this paper, we give a near-optimal patrol allocation algorithm and a 1/2-approximation algorithm, the latter of which is more efficient and yields simpler, more practical patrol allocations. Our simulations indicate that these algorithms substantially outperform existing heuristic allocations.",AAAI
Deploying PAWS: Field Optimization of the Protection Assistant for Wildlife Security,2016,"Poaching is a serious threat to the conservation of key species and whole ecosystems. While conducting foot patrols is the most commonly used approach in many countries to prevent poaching, such patrols often do not make the best use of limited patrolling resources. To remedy this situation, prior work introduced a novel emerging application called PAWS (Protection Assistant for Wildlife Security); PAWS was proposed as a game-theoretic (``security games'') decision aid to optimize the use of patrolling resources. This paper reports on PAWS's significant evolution from a proposed decision aid to a regularly deployed application, reporting on the lessons from the first tests in Africa in Spring 2014, through its continued evolution since then, to current regular use in Southeast Asia and plans for future worldwide deployment. In this process, we have worked closely with two NGOs (Panthera and Rimba) and incorporated extensive feedback from professional patrolling teams. We outline key technical advances that lead to PAWS's regular deployment: (i) incorporating complex topographic features, e.g., ridgelines, in generating patrol routes; (ii) handling uncertainties in species distribution (game theoretic payoffs); (iii) ensuring scalability for patrolling large-scale conservation areas with fine-grained guidance; and (iv) handling complex patrol scheduling constraints.",AAAI
Scalable Randomized Patrolling for Securing Rapid Transit Networks,2013,"Mass Rapid Transit using rail is a popular mode of transport employed by millions of people in many urban cities across the world. Typically, these networks are massive, used by many and thus, can be a soft target for criminals.In this paper, we consider the problem of scheduling randomised patrols for improved security of such rail networks. Similar to existing work in randomised patrols for protecting critical infrastructure, we also employ Stackelberg Games to represent the problem. In solving the Stackelberg games for massive rail networks, we make two key contributions. Firstly, we provide an approach called RaPtoR for computing randomized strategies in patrol teams, which guarantees (i) Strong Stackelberg equilibrium (SSE); and (ii) Optimality in terms of distance travelled by the patrol teams for specific constraints on schedules. Secondly, we demonstrate RaPtoR on a real world data set corresponding to the rail network in Singapore. Furthermore, we also show that the algorithm scales easily to large rail networks while providing SSE randomized strategies.",AAAI
Deploying Machine Learning Models for Public Policy: A Framework,2018,"Machine learning research typically focuses on optimization and testing on a few criteria, but deployment in a public policy setting requires more. Technical and non-technical deployment issues get relatively little attention. However, for machine learning models to have real-world benefit and impact, effective deployment is crucial. In this case study, we describe our implementation of a machine learning early intervention system (EIS) for police officers in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg (North Carolina) and Metropolitan Nashville (Tennessee) Police Departments. The EIS identifies officers at high risk of having an adverse incident, such as an unjustified use of force or sustained complaint. We deployed the same code base at both departments, which have different underlying data sources and data structures. Deployment required us to solve several new problems, covering technical implementation, governance of the system, the cost to use the system, and trust in the system. In this paper we describe how we addressed and solved several of these challenges and provide guidance and a framework of important issues to consider for future deployments.",KDD
Identifying Police Officers at Risk of Adverse Events,2016,"Adverse events between police and the public, such as deadly shootings or instances of racial profiling, can cause serious or deadly harm, damage police legitimacy, and result in costly litigation. Evidence suggests these events can be prevented by targeting interventions based on an Early Intervention System (EIS) that flags police officers who are at a high risk for involvement in such adverse events. Today's EIS are not data-driven and typically rely on simple thresholds based entirely on expert intuition. In this paper, we describe our work with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department (CMPD) to develop a machine learning model to predict which officers are at risk for an adverse event. Our approach significantly outperforms CMPD's existing EIS, increasing true positives by ~12% and decreasing false positives by ~32%. Our work also sheds light on features related to officer characteristics, situational factors, and neighborhood factors that are predictive of adverse events. This work provides a starting point for police departments to take a comprehensive, data-driven approach to improve policing and reduce harm to both officers and members of the public.",KDD
On Estimating the Swapping Rate for Categorical Data,2015,"When analyzing data, it is important to account for all sources of noise. Public use datasets, such as those provided by the Census Bureau, often undergo additional perturbations designed to protect confidentiality. This source of noise is generally ignored in data analysis because crucial parameters and details about its implementation are withheld. In this paper, we consider the problem of inferring such parameters from the data. Specifically, we target data swapping, a perturbation technique commonly used by the U.S. Census Bureau and which, barring practical breakthroughs in disclosure control, will be used in the foreseeable future. The vanilla version of data swapping selects pairs of records and exchanges some of their attribute values. The number of swapped records is kept secret even though it is needed for data analysis and investigations into the confidentiality protection of individual records. We propose algorithms for estimating the number of swapped records in categorical data, even when the true data distribution is unknown.",KDD
When Security Games Go Green: Designing Defender Strategies to Prevent Poaching and Illegal Fishing,2015,"Building on the successful applications of Stackelberg Security Games (SSGs) to protect infrastructure, researchers have begun focusing on applying game theory to green security domains such as protection of endangered animals and fish stocks. Previous efforts in these domains optimize defender strategies based on the standard Stackelberg assumption that the adversaries become fully aware of the defender's strategy before taking action. Unfortunately, this assumption is inappropriate since adversaries in green security domains often lack the resources to fully track the defender strategy. This paper (i) introduces Green Security Games (GSGs), a novel game model for green security domains with a generalized Stackelberg assumption; (ii) provides algorithms to plan effective sequential defender strategies Ã¢â¬â such planning was absent in previous work; (iii) proposes a novel approach to learn adversary models that further improves defender performance; and (iv) provides detailed experimental analysis of proposed approaches.",IJCAI
Logistic Methods for Resource Selection Functions and Presence-Only Species Distribution Models,2011,"In order to better protect and conserve biodiversity, ecologists use machine learning and statistics to understand how species respond to their environment and to predict how they will respond to future climate change, habitat loss and other threats. A fundamental modeling task is to estimate the probability that a given species is present in (or uses) a site, conditional on environmental variables such as precipitation and temperature. For a limited number of species, survey data consisting of both presence and absence records are available, and can be used to fit a variety of conventional classification and regression models. For most species, however, the available data consist only of occurrence records --- locations where the species has been observed. In two closely-related but separate bodies of ecological literature, diverse special-purpose models have been developed that contrast occurrence data with a random sample of available environmental conditions. The most widespread statistical approaches involve either fitting an exponential model of species' conditional probability of presence, or fitting a naive logistic model in which the random sample of available conditions is treated as absence data; both approaches have well-known drawbacks, and do not necessarily produce valid probabilities. After summarizing existing methods, we overcome their drawbacks by introducing a new scaled binomial loss function for estimating an underlying logistic model of species presence/absence. Like the Expectation-Maximization approach of Ward et al. and the method of Steinberg and Cardell, our approach requires an estimate of population prevalence, $\Pr(y=1)$, since prevalence is not identifiable from occurrence data alone. In contrast to the latter two methods, our loss function is straightforward to integrate into a variety of existing modeling frameworks such as generalized linear and additive models and boosted regression trees. We also demonstrate that approaches by Lele and Keim and by Lancaster and Imbens that surmount the identifiability issue by making parametric data assumptions do not typically produce valid probability estimates.",AAAI
k-Support anonymity based on pseudo taxonomy for outsourcing of frequent itemset mining,2010,"For any outsourcing service, privacy is a major concern. This paper focuses on outsourcing frequent itemset mining and examines the issue on how to protect privacy against the case where the attackers have precise knowledge on the supports of some items. We propose a new approach referred to as k-support anonymity to protect each sensitive item with k-1 other items of similar support. To achieve k-support anonymity, we introduce a pseudo taxonomy tree and have the third party mine the generalized frequent itemsets under the corresponding generalized association rules instead of association rules. The pseudo taxonomy is a construct to facilitate hiding of the original items, where each original item can map to either a leaf node or an internal node in the taxonomy tree. The rationale for this approach is that with a taxonomy tree, the k nodes to satisfy the k-support anonymity may be any k nodes in the taxonomy tree with the appropriate supports. So this approach can provide more candidates for k-support anonymity with limited fake items as only the leaf nodes, not the internal nodes, of the taxonomy tree need to appear in the transactions. Otherwise for the association rule mining, the k nodes to satisfy the k-support anonymity have to correspond to the leaf nodes in the taxonomy tree. This is far more restricted. The challenge is thus on how to generate the pseudo taxonomy tree to facilitate k-support anonymity and to ensure the conservation of original frequent itemsets. The experimental results showed that our methods of k-support anonymity can achieve very good privacy protection with moderate storage overhead.",KDD
Efficient Resource Allocation for Protecting Coral Reef Ecosystems,2016,"Coral reefs are valuable and fragile ecosystems which are under threat from human activities like coral mining. Many countries have built marine protected areas (MPAs) and protect their ecosystems through boat patrol. However, it remains a significant challenge to efficiently patrol the MPAs given the limited patrol resources of the protection agency and potential destructors' strategic actions. In this paper, we view the problem of efficiently patrolling for protecting coral reef ecosystems from a game-theoretic perspective and propose 1) a new Stackelberg game model to formulate the problem of protecting MPAs, 2) two algorithms to compute the efficient protection agency's strategies: CLP in which the protection agency's strategies are compactly represented as fractional flows in a network, and CDOG which combines the techniques of compactly representing defender strategies and incrementally generating strategies. Experimental results show that our approach leads to significantly better solution quality than that of previous works.",IJCAI
CAPTURE: A New Predictive Anti-Poaching Tool for Wildlife Protection (Page 767),2016,"Wildlife poaching presents a serious extinction threat to many animal species. Agencies (""defenders"") focused on protecting such animals need tools that help analyze, model and predict poacher activities, so they can more effectively combat such poaching; such tools could also assist in planning effective defender patrols, building on the previous security games research. To that end, we have built a new predictive anti-poaching tool, CAPTURE (Comprehensive Anti-Poaching tool with Temporal and observation Uncertainty REasoning). CAPTURE provides four main contributions. First, CAPTURE's modeling of poachers provides significant advances over previous models from behavioral game theory and conservation biology. This accounts for:(i) the defender's imperfect detection of poaching signs; (ii) complex temporal dependencies in the poacher's behaviors; (iii) lack of knowledge of numbers of poachers. Second, we provide two new heuristics: parameter separation and target abstraction to reduce the computational complexity in learning the poacher models. Third, we present a new game-theoretic algorithm for computing the defender's optimal patrolling given the complex poacher model. Finally, we present detailed models and analysis of real-world poaching data collected over 12 years in Queen Elizabeth National Park in Uganda to evaluate our new model's prediction accuracy. This paper thus presents the largest dataset of real-world defender-adversary interactions analyzed in the security games literature. CAPTURE will be tested in Uganda in early 2016.",AAMAS
Estimating Latent People Flow without Tracking Individuals,2018,"Analyzing people flows is important for better navigation and location-based advertising. Since the location information of people is often aggregated for protecting privacy, it is not straightforward to estimate transition populations between locations from aggregated data. Here, aggregated data are incoming and outgoing people counts at each location; they do not contain tracking information of individuals. This paper proposes a probabilistic model for estimating unobserved transition populations between locations from only aggregated data. With the proposed model, temporal dynamics of people flows are assumed to be probabilistic diffusion processes over a network, where nodes are locations and edges are paths between locations. By maximizing the likelihood with flow conservation constraints that incorporate travel duration distributions between locations, our model can robustly estimate transition populations between locations. The statistically significant improvement of our model is demonstrated using real-world datasets of pedestrian data in exhibition halls, bike trip data and taxi trip data in New York City.",IJCAI
Guilt by association: large scale malware detection by mining file-relation graphs,2014,"The increasing sophistication of malicious software calls for new defensive techniques that are harder to evade, and are capable of protecting users against novel threats. We present AESOP, a scalable algorithm that identifies malicious executable files by applying Aesop's moral that ""a man is known by the company he keeps."" We use a large dataset voluntarily contributed by the members of Norton Community Watch, consisting of partial lists of the files that exist on their machines, to identify close relationships between files that often appear together on machines. AESOP leverages locality-sensitive hashing to measure the strength of these inter-file relationships to construct a graph, on which it performs large scale inference by propagating information from the labeled files (as benign or malicious) to the preponderance of unlabeled files. AESOP attained early labeling of 99% of benign files and 79% of malicious files, over a week before they are labeled by the state-of-the-art techniques, with a 0.9961 true positive rate at flagging malware, at 0.0001 false positive rate.",KDD
TrajGuard: A Comprehensive Trajectory Copyright Protection Scheme,2019,"Trajectory data has been widely used in many urban applications. Sharing trajectory data with effective supervision is a vital task, as it contains private information of moving objects. However, malicious data users can modify trajectories in various ways to avoid data distribution tracking by the hashing-based data signatures, e.g., MD5. Moreover, the existing trajectory data protection scheme can only protect trajectories from either spatial or temporal modifications. Finally, so far there is no authoritative third party for trajectory data sharing process, as trajectory data is too sensitive. To this end, we propose a novel trajectory copyright protection scheme, which can protect trajectory data from comprehensive types of data modifications/attacks. Three main techniques are employed to effectively guarantee the robustness and comprehensiveness of the proposed data sharing scheme: 1) the identity information is embedded distributively across a set of sub-trajectories partitioned based on the spatio-temporal regions; 2) the centroid distance of the sub-trajectories is served as a stable trajectory attribute to embed the information; and 3) the blockchain technique is used as a trusted third party to log all data transaction history for data distribution tracking in a decentralized manner. Extensive experiments were conducted based on two real-world trajectory datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.",KDD
Protecting location privacy using location semantics,2011,"As the use of mobile devices increases, a location-based service (LBS) becomes increasingly popular because it provides more convenient context-aware services. However, LBS introduces problematic issues for location privacy due to the nature of the service. Location privacy protection methods based on k-anonymity and l-diversity have been proposed to provide anonymized use of LBS. However, the k-anonymity and l-diversity methods still can endanger the user's privacy because location semantic information could easily be breached while using LBS. This paper presents a novel location privacy protection technique, which protects the location semantics from an adversary. In our scheme, location semantics are first learned from location data. Then, the trusted-anonymization server performs the anonymization using the location semantic information by cloaking with semantically heterogeneous locations. Thus, the location semantic information is kept secure as the cloaking is done with semantically heterogeneous locations and the true location information is not delivered to the LBS applications. This paper proposes algorithms for learning location semantics and achieving semantically secure cloaking.",KDD
Remote Management of Boundary Protection Devices with Information Restrictions,2019,"Boundary Protection Devices (BPDs) are used by US Government mission partners to regulate the flow of information across networks of differing security levels. BPDs provide several critical functions, including preventing unauthorized sharing, sanitizing information, and preventing cyber attacks. Their application in national security and critical infrastructure environments (e.g., military missions, nuclear power plants, clean water distribution systems) calls for a comprehensive load monitoring system that provides resilience and scalability, as well as an automated and vendor neutral configuration management system that can efficiently respond to security threats at machine speed. Their design as one-way traffic control systems, however, presents challenges for dynamic load adaptation techniques that require access to application server performance metrics across network boundaries. Moreover, the structured review and approval process that regulates their configuration and use presents two significant challenges: (1) Adaptation techniques that alter the configuration of BPDs must be predictable, understandable, and pre-approved by administrators, and (2) Software can be installed on BPDs only after completing a stringent accreditation process. These challenges often lead to manual configuration management practices, which are inefficient or ineffective in many cases. The Hammerhead prototype, developed as part of the SHARC project, addresses these challenges using knowledge representation, a rule-oriented adaptation bundle format, and an extensible, open-source constraint solver.",AAAI
A privacy preserving framework for managing vehicle data in road pricing systems,2013,"The Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) system was implemented by the Land Transport Authority of Singapore to control traffic by road pricing since 1998. To better understand the traffic condition and improve the pricing scheme, the government initiated the next generation ERP (ERP 2) project, which aims to use the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) collecting positional data from vehicles for analysis. However, most drivers fear of being monitored once the government installs the devices in their vehicles to collect GPS data. The existing data stream management systems (DSMS) centralize both data management and privacy control at server site. This framework assumes DSMS server is secure and trustable, and protects providers' data from illegal access by data users. In ERP 2, the DSMS server is maintained by the government, i.e., data user. Thus, the existing framework is not adoptable. We propose a novel framework in which privacy protection is pushed to data provider site. By doing this, the system could be safer and more efficient. Our framework can be used for the situations such as ERP 2, i.e., data providers would like to control their own privacy policies and/or the workload of DSMS server needs to be reduced.",KDD
QuickPup: A Heuristic Backtracking Algorithm for the Partner Units Configuration Problem,2012,"The Partner Units Problem (PUP) constitutes a challenging real-world configuration problem with diverse application domains such as railway safety, security monitoring, electrical engineering, or distributed systems.Although using the latest problem-solving methods including Constraint Programming, SAT Solving,Integer Programming, and Answer Set Programming, current methods fail to generate solutions for mid-sized real-world problems in acceptable time. This paper presents the QuickPup algorithm based on backtrack search combined with smart variable orderings and restarts. QuickPup outperforms the available methods by orders of magnitude and thus makes it possible toautomatically solve problems which couldnÃ¢â¬â¢t be solved without human expertise before. Furthermore, the runtimes of QuickPup are typically below one second for real-world problem instances.",AAAI
A Testbed for Investigating Task Allocation Strategies between Air Traffic Controllers and Automated Agents,2010,"To meet the growing demands of the National Airspace System (NAS) stakeholders and provide the level of service, safety and security needed to sustain future air transport, the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) concept calls for technologies and systems offering increasing support from automated systems that provide decision-aiding and optimization capabilities. This is an exciting application for some core aspects of Artificial Intelligence research since the automation must be designed to enable the human operators to access and process a myriad of information sources, understand heightened system complexity, and maximize capacity, throughput and fuel savings in the NAS.. This paper introduces an emerging application of techniques from mixed initiative (adjustable autonomy), multi-agent systems, and task scheduling techniques to the air traffic control domain. Consequently, we have created a testbed for investigating the critical challenges in supporting the early design of systems that allow for optimal, context-sensitive function (role) allocation between air traffic controller and automated agents. A pilot study has been conducted with the testbed and preliminary results show a marked qualitative improvement in using dynamic function allocation optimization versus static function allocation.",AAAI
Catch Me If You Can: Detecting Pickpocket Suspects from Large-Scale Transit Records,2016,"Massive data collected by automated fare collection (AFC) systems provide opportunities for studying both personal traveling behaviors and collective mobility patterns in the urban area. Existing studies on the AFC data have primarily focused on identifying passengers' movement patterns. In this paper, however, we creatively leveraged such data for identifying thieves in the public transit systems. Indeed, stopping pickpockets in the public transit systems has been critical for improving passenger satisfaction and public safety. However, it is challenging to tell thieves from regular passengers in practice. To this end, we developed a suspect detection and surveillance system, which can identify pick-pocket suspects based on their daily transit records. Specifically, we first extracted a number of features from each passenger's daily activities in the transit systems. Then, we took a two-step approach that exploits the strengths of unsupervised outlier detection and supervised classification models to identify thieves, who exhibit abnormal traveling behaviors. Experimental results demonstrated the effective- ness of our method. We also developed a prototype system with a user-friendly interface for the security personnel.",KDD
You Are How You Drive: Peer and Temporal-Aware Representation Learning for Driving Behavior Analysis,2018,"Driving is a complex activity that requires multi-level skilled operations (e.g., acceleration, braking, turning). Analyzing driving behavior can help us assess driver performances, improve traffic safety, and, ultimately, promote the development of intelligent and resilient transportation systems. While some efforts have been made for analyzing driving behavior, existing methods can be improved via representation learning by jointly exploring the peer and temporal dependencies of driving behavior. To that end, in this paper, we develop a Peer and Temporal-Aware Representation Learning based framework (PTARL) for driving behavior analysis with GPS trajectory data. Specifically, we first detect the driving operations and states of each driver from GPS traces. Then, we derive a sequence of multi-view driving state transition graphs from the driving state sequences, in order to characterize a driver's driving behavior that varies over time. In addition, we develop a peer and temporal-aware representation learning method to learn a sequence of time-varying yet relational vectorized representations from the driving state transition graphs. The proposed method can simultaneously model both the graph-graph peer dependency and the current-past temporal dependency in a unified optimization framework. Also, we provide effective solutions for the optimization problem. Moreover, we exploit the learned representations of driving behavior to score driving performances and detect dangerous regions. Finally, extensive experimental results with big trajectory data demonstrate the enhanced performance of the proposed method for driving behavior analysis.",KDD
Aircraft Trajectory Prediction Made Easy with Predictive Analytics,2016,"At the heart of Air Traffic Management (ATM) lies the Decision Support Systems (DST) that rely upon accurate trajectory prediction to determine how the airspace will look like in the future to make better decisions and advisories. Dealing with airspace that is prone to congestion due to environmental factors still remains the challenge especially when a deterministic approach is used in the trajectory prediction process. In this paper, we describe a novel stochastic trajectory prediction approach for ATM that can be used for more efficient and realistic flight planning and to assist airspace flow management, potentially resulting in higher safety, capacity, and efficiency commensurate with fuel savings thereby reducing emissions for a better environment. Our approach considers airspace as a 3D grid network, where each grid point is a location of a weather observation. We hypothetically build cubes around these grid points, so the entire airspace can be considered as a set of cubes. Each cube is defined by its centroid, the original grid point, and associated weather parameters that remain homogeneous within the cube during a period of time. Then, we align raw trajectories to a set of cube centroids which are basically fixed 3D positions independent of trajectory data. This creates a new form of trajectories which are 4D joint cubes, where each cube is a segment that is associated with not only spatio-temporal attributes but also with weather parameters. Next, we exploit machine learning techniques to train inference models from historical data and apply a stochastic model, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), to predict trajectories taking environmental uncertainties into account. During the process, we apply time series clustering to generate input observations from an excessive set of weather parameters to feed into the Viterbi algorithm. Our experiments use a real trajectory dataset with pertaining weather observations and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to the trajectory prediction process for ATM.",KDD
Beyond heuristics: learning to classify vulnerabilities and predict exploits,2010,"The security demands on modern system administration are enormous and getting worse. Chief among these demands, administrators must monitor the continual ongoing disclosure of software vulnerabilities that have the potential to compromise their systems in some way. Such vulnerabilities include buffer overflow errors, improperly validated inputs, and other unanticipated attack modalities. In 2008, over 7,400 new vulnerabilities were disclosed--well over 100 per week. While no enterprise is affected by all of these disclosures, administrators commonly face many outstanding vulnerabilities across the software systems they manage. Vulnerabilities can be addressed by patches, reconfigurations, and other workarounds; however, these actions may incur down-time or unforeseen side-effects. Thus, a key question for systems administrators is which vulnerabilities to prioritize. From publicly available databases that document past vulnerabilities, we show how to train classifiers that predict whether and how soon a vulnerability is likely to be exploited. As input, our classifiers operate on high dimensional feature vectors that we extract from the text fields, time stamps, cross references, and other entries in existing vulnerability disclosure reports. Compared to current industry-standard heuristics based on expert knowledge and static formulas, our classifiers predict much more accurately whether and how soon individual vulnerabilities are likely to be exploited.",KDD
Fast Memory-efficient Anomaly Detection in Streaming Heterogeneous Graphs,2016,"Given a stream of heterogeneous graphs containing different types of nodes and edges, how can we spot anomalous ones in real-time while consuming bounded memory? This problem is motivated by and generalizes from its application in security to host-level advanced persistent threat (APT) detection. We propose StreamSpot, a clustering based anomaly detection approach that addresses challenges in two key fronts: (1) heterogeneity, and (2) streaming nature. We introduce a new similarity function for heterogeneous graphs that compares two graphs based on their relative frequency of local substructures, represented as short strings. This function lends itself to a vector representation of a graph, which is (a) fast to compute, and (b) amenable to a sketched version with bounded size that preserves similarity.
 StreamSpot exhibits desirable properties that a streaming application requires: it is (i) fully-streaming; processing the stream one edge at a time as it arrives, (ii) memory-efficient; requiring constant space for the sketches and the clustering, (iii) fast; taking constant time to update the graph sketches and the cluster summaries that can process over 100,000 edges per second, and (iv) online; scoring and flagging anomalies in real time. Experiments on datasets containing simulated system-call flow graphs from normal browser activity and various attack scenarios (ground truth) show that StreamSpot is high-performance; achieving above 95% detection accuracy with small delay, as well as competitive time and memory usage.",KDD
Active Malware Analysis using Stochastic Games,2012,"Cyber security is increasingly important for defending computer systems from loss of privacy or unauthorised use. One important aspect is threat analysis --- how does an attacker infiltrate a system and what do they want once they are inside. This paper considers the problem of Active Malware Analysis, where we learn about the human or software intruder by actively interacting with it with the goal of learning about its behaviours and intentions, whilst at the same time that intruder may be trying to avoid detection or showing those behaviours and intentions. This game-theoretic active learning is then used to obtain a behavioural clustering of malware, an important contribution for both understanding malware at a high level and more crucially, for the deployment of effective anti-malware defences. This paper makes the following contributions: (i) A formal definition of the game-theoretic active malware analysis problem; (ii) A fast algorithm for learning about a malware in the active analysis problem which utilises the concept of reducing entropy in the beliefs about the malware; (iii) A virtual machine based agent architecture for the implementation of the active malware analysis problem and (iv) A behaviour based clustering of malware behaviour which is shown to be more accurate than a similar clustering using only passive information about the malware.",AAMAS
Optimal Patrol Strategy for Protecting Moving Targets with Multiple Mobile Resources (Page 957),2013,"Previous work on Stackelberg Security Games for scheduling security resources has mostly assumed that the targets are stationary relative to the defender and the attacker, leading to discrete game models with finite numbers of pure strategies. This paper in contrast focuses on protecting mobile targets that lead to a continuous set of strategies for the players. The problem is motivated by several real-world domains including protecting ferries with escorts and protecting refugee supply lines. Our contributions include: (i) a new game model for multiple mobile defender resources and moving targets with a discretized strategy space for the defender and a continuous strategy space for the attacker; (ii) an efficient linear-program-based solution that uses a compact representation for the defender's mixed strategy, while accurately modeling the attacker's continuous strategy using a novel sub-interval analysis method; (iii) a heuristic method of equilibrium refinement for improved robustness and (iv) detailed experimental analysis in the ferry protection domain.",AAMAS
Detecting bots via incremental LS-SVM learning with dynamic feature adaptation,2011,"As botnets continue to proliferate and grow in sophistication, so does the need for more advanced security solutions to effectively detect and defend against such attacks. In particular, botnets such as Conficker have been known to encrypt the communication packets exchanged between bots and their command-and-control server, making it costly for existing botnet detection systems that rely on deep packet inspection (DPI) methods to identify compromised machines. In this paper, we argue that, even in the face of encrypted traffic flows, botnets can still be detected by examining the set of server IP-addresses visited by a client machine in the past. However there are several challenges that must be addressed. First, the set of server IP-addresses visited by client machines may evolve dynamically. Second, the set of client machines used for training and their class labels may also change over time. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents a novel incremental LS-SVM algorithm that is adaptive to both changes in the feature set and class labels of training instances. To evaluate the performance of our algorithm, we have performed experiments on two large-scale datasets, including real-time data collected from peering routers at a large Tier-1 ISP. Experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm produces classification accuracy comparable to its batch counterpart, while consuming significantly less computational resources.",KDD
Gotcha - Sly Malware!: Scorpion A Metagraph2vec Based Malware Detection System,2018,"Due to its severe damages and threats to the security of the Internet and computing devices, malware detection has caught the attention of both anti-malware industry and researchers for decades. To combat the evolving malware attacks, in this paper, we first study how to utilize both content- and relation-based features to characterize sly malware; to model different types of entities (i.e., file, archive, machine, API, DLL ) and the rich semantic relationships among them (i.e., file-archive, file-machine, file-file, API-DLL, file-API relations), we then construct a structural heterogeneous information network (HIN) and present meta-graph based approach to depict the relatedness over files. To measure the relatedness over files on the constructed HIN, since malware detection is a cost-sensitive task, it calls for efficient methods to learn latent representations for HIN. To address this challenge, based on the built meta-graph schemes, we propose a new HIN embedding model metagraph2vec on the first attempt to learn the low-dimensional representations for the nodes in HIN, where both the HIN structures and semantics are maximally preserved for malware detection. A comprehensive experimental study on the real sample collections from Comodo Cloud Security Center is performed to compare various malware detection approaches. The promising experimental results demonstrate that our developed system Scorpion which integrate our proposed method outperforms other alternative malware detection techniques. The developed system has already been incorporated into the scanning tool of Comodo Antivirus product.",KDD
Machine Learning for Encrypted Malware Traffic Classification: Accounting for Noisy Labels and Non-Stationarity,2017,"The application of machine learning for the detection of malicious network traffic has been well researched over the past several decades; it is particularly appealing when the traffic is encrypted because traditional pattern-matching approaches cannot be used. Unfortunately, the promise of machine learning has been slow to materialize in the network security domain. In this paper, we highlight two primary reasons why this is the case: inaccurate ground truth and a highly non-stationary data distribution. To demonstrate and understand the effect that these pitfalls have on popular machine learning algorithms, we design and carry out experiments that show how six common algorithms perform when confronted with real network data. With our experimental results, we identify the situations in which certain classes of algorithms underperform on the task of encrypted malware traffic classification. We offer concrete recommendations for practitioners given the real-world constraints outlined. From an algorithmic perspective, we find that the random forest ensemble method outperformed competing methods. More importantly, feature engineering was decisive; we found that iterating on the initial feature set, and including features suggested by domain experts, had a much greater impact on the performance of the classification system. For example, linear regression using the more expressive feature set easily outperformed the random forest method using a standard network traffic representation on all criteria considered. Our analysis is based on millions of TLS encrypted sessions collected over 12 months from a commercial malware sandbox and two geographically distinct, large enterprise networks.",KDD
Combining file content and file relations for cloud based malware detection,2011,"Due to their damages to Internet security, malware (such as virus, worms, trojans, spyware, backdoors, and rootkits) detection has caught the attention not only of anti-malware industry but also of researchers for decades. Resting on the analysis of file contents extracted from the file samples, like Application Programming Interface (API) calls, instruction sequences, and binary strings, data mining methods such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines have been used for malware detection. However, besides file contents, relations among file samples, such as a ""Downloader"" is always associated with many Trojans, can provide invaluable information about the properties of file samples. In this paper, we study how file relations can be used to improve malware detection results and develop a file verdict system (named ""Valkyrie"") building on a semi-parametric classifier model to combine file content and file relations together for malware detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of using both file content and file relations for malware detection. A comprehensive experimental study on a large collection of PE files obtained from the clients of anti-malware products of Comodo Security Solutions Incorporation is performed to compare various malware detection approaches. Promising experimental results demonstrate that the accuracy and efficiency of our Valkyrie system outperform other popular anti-malware software tools such as Kaspersky AntiVirus and McAfee VirusScan, as well as other alternative data mining based detection systems.",KDD
DeepFuzz: Automatic Generation of Syntax Valid C Programs for Fuzz Testing,2019,"Compilers are among the most fundamental programming tools for building software. However, production compilers remain buggy. Fuzz testing is often leveraged with newlygenerated, or mutated inputs in order to find new bugs or security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose a grammarbased fuzzing tool called DEEPFUZZ. Based on a generative Sequence-to-Sequence model, DEEPFUZZ automatically and continuously generates well-formed C programs. We use this set of new C programs to fuzz off-the-shelf C compilers, e.g., GCC and Clang/LLVM. We present a detailed case study to analyze the success rate and coverage improvement of the generated C programs for fuzz testing. We analyze the performance of DEEPFUZZ with three types of sampling methods as well as three types of generation strategies. Consequently, DEEPFUZZ improved the testing efficacy in regards to the line, function, and branch coverage. In our preliminary study, we found and reported 8 bugs of GCC, all of which are actively being addressed by developers.",AAAI
Design Privacy with Analogia Graph,2010,"Human vision is often guided by instinctual commonsense such as proportions and contours. In this paper, we explore how to use the proportion as the key knowledge for designing a privacy algorithm that detects human private parts in a 3D scan dataset. The Analogia Graph is introduced to study the proportion of structures. It is a graph-based representation of the proportion knowledge. The intrinsic human proportions are applied to reduce the search space by an order of magnitude. A feature shape template is constructed to match the model data points using Radial Basis Functions in a non-linear regression and the relative measurements of the height and area factors. The method is tested on 100 datasets from CAESAR database. Two surface rendering methods are studied for data privacy: blurring and transparency. It is found that test subjects normally prefer to have the most possible privacy in both rendering methods. However, the subjects adjusted their privacy measurement to a certain degree as they were informed the context of security.",AAAI
Next-Step Suggestions for Modern Interactive Data Analysis Platforms,2018,"Modern Interactive Data Analysis (IDA) platforms, such as Kibana, Splunk, and Tableau, are gradually replacing traditional OLAP/SQL tools, as they allow for easy-to-use data exploration, visualization, and mining, even for users lacking SQL and programming skills. Nevertheless, data analysis is still a di cult task, especially for non-expert users. To that end we present REACT, a recommender system designed for modern IDA platforms. In these platforms, analysis sessions interweave high-level actions of multiple types and operate over diverse datasets . REACT identifies and generalizes relevant (previous) sessions to generate personalized next-action suggestions to the user.
 We model the user's analysis context using a generic tree based model, where the edges represent the user's recent actions, and the nodes represent their result ""screens"". A dedicated context-similarity metric is employed for efficient indexing and retrieval of relevant candidate next-actions. These are then generalized to abstract actions that convey common fragments, then adapted to the specific user context. To prove the utility of REACT we performed an extensive online and offline experimental evaluation over real-world analysis logs from the cyber security domain, which we also publish to serve as a benchmark dataset for future work.",KDD
Distributed Multi-Task Relationship Learning,2017,"Multi-task learning aims to learn multiple tasks jointly by exploiting their relatedness to improve the generalization performance for each task. Traditionally, to perform multi-task learning, one needs to centralize data from all the tasks to a single machine. However, in many real-world applications, data of different tasks may be geo-distributed over different local machines. Due to heavy communication caused by transmitting the data and the issue of data privacy and security, it is impossible to send data of different task to a master machine to perform multi-task learning. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a distributed multi-task learning framework that simultaneously learns predictive models for each task as well as task relationships between tasks alternatingly in the parameter server paradigm. In our framework, we first offer a general dual form for a family of regularized multi-task relationship learning methods. Subsequently, we propose a communication-efficient primal-dual distributed optimization algorithm to solve the dual problem by carefully designing local subproblems to make the dual problem decomposable. Moreover, we provide a theoretical convergence analysis for the proposed algorithm, which is specific for distributed multi-task relationship learning. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to evaluate our proposed framework in terms of effectiveness and convergence.",KDD
Organizational Chart Inference,2015,"Nowadays, to facilitate the communication and cooperation among employees, a new family of online social networks has been adopted in many companies, which are called the ""enterprise social networks"" (ESNs). ESNs can provide employees with various professional services to help them deal with daily work issues. Meanwhile, employees in companies are usually organized into different hierarchies according to the relative ranks of their positions. The company internal management structure can be outlined with the organizational chart visually, which is normally confidential to the public out of the privacy and security concerns. In this paper, we want to study the IOC (Inference of Organizational Chart) problem to identify company internal organizational chart based on the heterogeneous online ESN launched in it. IOC is very challenging to address as, to guarantee smooth operations, the internal organizational charts of companies need to meet certain structural requirements (about its depth and width). To solve the IOC problem, a novel unsupervised method Create (ChArT REcovEr) is proposed in this paper, which consists of 3 steps: (1) social stratification of ESN users into different social classes, (2) supervision link inference from managers to subordinates, and (3) consecutive social classes matching to prune the redundant supervision links. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world online ESN dataset demonstrate that Create can perform very well in addressing the IOC problem.",KDD
Cost-sensitive online active learning with application to malicious URL detection,2013,"Malicious Uniform Resource Locator (URL) detection is an important problem in web search and mining, which plays a critical role in internet security. In literature, many existing studies have attempted to formulate the problem as a regular supervised binary classification task, which typically aims to optimize the prediction accuracy. However, in a real-world malicious URL detection task, the ratio between the number of malicious URLs and legitimate URLs is highly imbalanced, making it very inappropriate for simply optimizing the prediction accuracy. Besides, another key limitation of the existing work is to assume a large amount of training data is available, which is impractical as the human labeling cost could be potentially quite expensive. To solve these issues, in this paper, we present a novel framework of Cost-Sensitive Online Active Learning (CSOAL), which only queries a small fraction of training data for labeling and directly optimizes two cost-sensitive measures to address the class-imbalance issue. In particular, we propose two CSOAL algorithms and analyze their theoretical performance in terms of cost-sensitive bounds. We conduct an extensive set of experiments to examine the empirical performance of the proposed algorithms for a large-scale challenging malicious URL detection task, in which the encouraging results showed that the proposed technique by querying an extremely small-sized labeled data (about 0.5% out of 1-million instances) can achieve better or highly comparable classification performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art cost-insensitive and cost-sensitive online classification algorithms using a huge amount of labeled data.",KDD
Discriminant malware distance learning on structural information for automated malware classification,2013,"The voluminous malware variants that appear in the Internet have posed severe threats to its security. In this work, we explore techniques that can automatically classify malware variants into their corresponding families. We present a generic framework that extracts structural information from malware programs as attributed function call graphs, in which rich malware features are encoded as attributes at the function level. Our framework further learns discriminant malware distance metrics that evaluate the similarity between the attributed function call graphs of two malware programs. To combine various types of malware attributes, our method adaptively learns the confidence level associated with the classification capability of each attribute type and then adopts an ensemble of classifiers for automated malware classification. We evaluate our approach with a number of Windows-based malware instances belonging to 11 families, and experimental results show that our automated malware classification method is able to achieve high classification accuracy.",KDD
Classification of software behaviors for failure detection: a discriminative pattern mining approach,2009,"Software is a ubiquitous component of our daily life. We often depend on the correct working of software systems. Due to the difficulty and complexity of software systems, bugs and anomalies are prevalent. Bugs have caused billions of dollars loss, in addition to privacy and security threats. In this work, we address software reliability issues by proposing a novel method to classify software behaviors based on past history or runs. With the technique, it is possible to generalize past known errors and mistakes to capture failures and anomalies. Our technique first mines a set of discriminative features capturing repetitive series of events from program execution traces. It then performs feature selection to select the best features for classification. These features are then used to train a classifier to detect failures. Experiments and case studies on traces of several benchmark software systems and a real-life concurrency bug from MySQL server show the utility of the technique in capturing failures and anomalies. On average, our pattern-based classification technique outperforms the baseline approach by 24.68% in accuracy.",KDD
Bridging centrality: graph mining from element level to group level,2008,"Despite the pervasiveness of networks as models for real world systems ranging from the Internet, the World Wide Web to gene regulation and scientific collaborations, only a limited number of metrics capable of characterizing these systems are available. The existing metrics for characterizing networks have broad specificity and lack the selectivity for many applications. The purpose of this paper is to identify and critically evaluate a metric, termed bridging centrality, which is highly selective for identifying bridges in networks. The properties of bridges are unique compared to the other network metrics. For a diverse range of data sets, we found that networks are highly susceptible to disruption but robust to loss structural integrity upon targeted deletion of bridging nodes. A novel graph clustering approach, termed `bridge cut', utilizing bridging edges as module boundary is also proposed. The modules identified by the bridge cut algorithm are more effective than the other graph clustering methods. Thus, bridging centrality is a network metric with unique properties that may aid in network analysis from element to group level in various areas including systems biology and national security applications.",KDD
Active Graph Reachability Reduction for Network Security and Software Engineering,2011,"Motivated by applications from computer network security and software engineering, we study the problem of reducing reachability on a graph with unknown edge costs. When the costs are known, reachability reduction can be solved using a linear relaxation of sparsest cut. Problems arise, however, when edge costs are unknown. In this case, blindly applying sparsest cut with incorrect edge costs can result in suboptimal or infeasible solutions. Instead, we propose to solve the problem via edge classification using feedback on individual edges. We show that this approach outperforms competing approaches in accuracy and efficiency on our target applications.",IJCAI
ThinSIM-based Attacks on Mobile Money Systems,2018,"Phone-based mobile money is becoming the dominant paradigm for financial services in the developing world. For example, mPesa has a cash flow of over thirty billion USD, equivalent to nearly half of Kenya's GDP. Inside of these markets, competitors have appeared who leverage ThinSIMS, small SIM-card add-ons, to provide alternative mobile money implementations. However, the security implications of ThinSIMs are not well understood. To resolve this, we explore the security of phone-based mobile money systems against attacks via the SIM interface, the 3GPP-defined interface between a SIM card and a phone. Using a ThinSIM to intercept and initiate communication over the SIM interface, we demonstrate that a malicious ThinSIM can steal a user's mPesa credentials and initiate transactions without the user's consent or knowledge. We also demonstrate a similar ThinSIM-based attack against USSD-based mobile money systems that allows for similar transactions without the user's knowledge or participation. Lastly, we propose and implement modifications to both STK and USSD-based mobile money systems to limit the impact of our discovered ThinSIM-based attacks.",COMPASS
Catching Captain Jack: Efficient Time and Space Dependent Patrols to Combat Oil-Siphoning in International Waters,2018,"Pirate syndicates capturing tankers to siphon oil, causing an estimated cost of $5 billion a year, has become a serious security issue for maritime traffic. In response to the threat, coast guards and navies deploy patrol boats to protect international oil trade. However, given the vast area of the sea and the highly time and space dependent behaviors of both players, it remains a significant challenge to find efficient ways to deploy patrol resources. In this paper, we address the research challenges and provide four key contributions. First, we construct a Stackelberg model of the oil-siphoning problem based on incident reports of actual attacks; Second, we propose a compact formulation and a constraint generation algorithm, which tackle the exponentially growth of the defenderÃ¢â¬â¢s and attackerÃ¢â¬â¢s strategy spaces, respectively, to compute efficient strategies of security agencies; Third, to further improve the scalability, we propose an abstraction method, which exploits the intrinsic similarity of defenderÃ¢â¬â¢s strategy space, to solve extremely large-scale games; Finally, we evaluate our approaches through extensive simulations and a detailed case study with real ship traffic data. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves a dramatic improvement of scalability with modest influence on the solution quality and can scale up to realistic-sized problems.",AAAI
Three strategies to success: Learning adversary models in security games,2016,"State-of-the-art applications of Stackelberg security games Ã¢â¬â including wildlife protection Ã¢â¬â offer a wealth of data, which can be used to learn the behavior of the adversary. But existing approaches either make strong assumptions about the structure of the data, or gather new data through online algorithms that are likely to play severely suboptimal strategies. We develop a new approach to learning the parameters of the behavioral model of a bounded rational attacker (thereby pinpointing a near optimal strategy), by observing how the attacker responds to only three defender strategies. We also validate our approach using experiments on real and synthetic data.",IJCAI
Preventing Illegal Logging: Simultaneous Optimization of Resource Teams and Tactics for Security,2016,"Green security Ã¢â¬â protection of forests, fish and wildlife Ã¢â¬â is a critical problem in environmental sustainability.

Privacy-preserving outsourcing support vector machines with random transformation,2010,"Outsourcing the training of support vector machines (SVM) to external service providers benefits the data owner who is not familiar with the techniques of the SVM or has limited computing resources. In outsourcing, the data privacy is a critical issue for some legal or commercial reasons since there may be sensitive information contained in the data. Existing privacy-preserving SVM works are either not applicable to outsourcing or weak in security. In this paper, we propose a scheme for privacy-preserving outsourcing the training of the SVM without disclosing the actual content of the data to the service provider. In the proposed scheme, the data sent to the service provider is perturbed by a random transformation, and the service provider trains the SVM for the data owner from the perturbed data. The proposed scheme is stronger in security than existing techniques, and incurs very little redundant communication and computation cost.",KDD
Information environment security,2014,"The US Department of Defense Dictionary of Military terms defines the Information Environment as 'the aggregate of individuals, organizations, and systems that collect, process, disseminate, or act on information.' The decisions and actions we take both as individuals and collectively simultaneously shape and are shaped by the information environment in which we live. The nature of our interaction with the information environment is rapidly evolving and old models are becoming irrelevant faster than we can develop new ones. This results in uncertainties that leave us exposed to dangerous influences without proper defenses. The purpose of this talk is to help frame a new science of Information Environment Security (IES) whose goal is to create and apply the tools needed to discover and maintain fundamental models of our ever-changing information environment and to defend us in that environment, both as individuals and collectively, against intentional as well as unintentional attempts to deceive, misinform and otherwise manipulate us. IES is an interdisciplinary science that will require bringing together experts working in areas such as cognitive science, computer science, social science, security, marketing, political campaigning, public policy, and psychology to develop a theoretical as well as an applied engineering methodology for managing the full spectrum of information environment security issues.",KDD
Comparing Strategic Secrecy and Stackelberg Commitment in Security Games,2017,"The Strong Stackelberg Equilibrium (SSE) has drawn extensive attention recently in several security domains. However, the SSE concept neglects the advantage of defender's strategic revelation of her private information, and overestimates the observation ability of the adversaries. In this paper, we overcome these restrictions and analyze the tradeoff between strategic secrecy and commitment in security games. We propose a Disguised-resource Security Game (DSG) where the defender strategically disguises some of her resources. We compare strategic information revelation with public commitment and formally show that they have different advantages depending the payoff structure. To compute the Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium (PBE), several novel approaches are provided, including a novel algorithm based on support set enumeration, and an approximation algorithm for \epsilon-PBE. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that both strategic secrecy and Stackelberg commitment are critical measures in security domain, and our approaches can efficiently solve PBEs for realistic-sized problems.",IJCAI
Examining Security and Privacy Research in Developing Regions,2018,"Prior research suggests that security and privacy needs of users in developing regions are different than those in developed regions. To better understand the underlying differentiating factors, we conducted a systematic review of Human-Computer Interaction for Development and Security & Privacy publications in 15 proceedings, such as CHI, SOUPS, ICTD, and DEV, from the past ten years. Through an in-depth analysis of 114 publications that discuss security and privacy needs of people in developing regions, we identified five key factors---culture, knowledge gaps, unintended technology use, context, and usability and cost considerations---that shape security and privacy preferences of people in developing regions. We discuss how these factors influence their security and privacy considerations using case studies on phone sharing and surveillance. We then present a set of design recommendations and research directions for addressing security and privacy needs of people in resource-constrained settings.",COMPASS
Cyber security: how visual analytics unlock insight,2013,"In the Cyber Security domain, we have been collecting 'big data' for almost two decades. The volume and variety of our data is extremely large, but understanding and capturing the semantics of the data is even more of a challenge. Finding the needle in the proverbial haystack has been attempted from many different angles. In this talk we will have a look at what approaches have been explored, what has worked, and what has not. We will see that there is still a large amount of work to be done and data mining is going to play a central role. We'll try to motivate that in order to successfully find bad guys, we will have to embrace a solution that not only leverages clever data mining, but employs the right mix between human computer interfaces, data mining, and scalable data platforms. Traditionally, cyber security has been having its challenges with data mining. We are different. We will explore how to adopt data mining algorithms to the security domain. Some approaches like predictive analytics are extremely hard, if not impossible. How would you predict the next cyber attack? Others need to be tailored to the security domain to make them work.
 Visualization and visual analytics seem to be extremely promising to solve cyber security issues. Situational awareness, large-scale data exploration, knowledge capture, and forensic investigations are four top use-cases we will discuss. Visualization alone, however, does not solve security problems. We need algorithms that support the visualizations. For example to reduce the amount of data so an analyst can deal with it, in both volume and semantics.",KDD
Mobile app recommendations with security and privacy awareness,2014,"With the rapid prevalence of smart mobile devices, the number of mobile Apps available has exploded over the past few years. To facilitate the choice of mobile Apps, existing mobile App recommender systems typically recommend popular mobile Apps to mobile users. However, mobile Apps are highly varied and often poorly understood, particularly for their activities and functions related to privacy and security. Therefore, more and more mobile users are reluctant to adopt mobile Apps due to the risk of privacy invasion and other security concerns. To fill this crucial void, in this paper, we propose to develop a mobile App recommender system with privacy and security awareness. The design goal is to equip the recommender system with the functionality which allows to automatically detect and evaluate the security risk of mobile Apps. Then, the recommender system can provide App recommendations by considering both the Apps' popularity and the users' security preferences. Specifically, a mobile App can lead to security risk because insecure data access permissions have been implemented in this App. Therefore, we first develop the techniques to automatically detect the potential security risk for each mobile App by exploiting the requested permissions. Then, we propose a flexible approach based on modern portfolio theory for recommending Apps by striking a balance between the Apps' popularity and the users' security concerns, and build an App hash tree to efficiently recommend Apps. Finally, we evaluate our approach with extensive experiments on a large-scale data set collected from Google Play. The experimental results clearly validate the effectiveness of our approach.",KDD
Category detection using hierarchical mean shift,2009,"Many applications in surveillance, monitoring, scientific discovery, and data cleaning require the identification of anomalies. Although many methods have been developed to identify statistically significant anomalies, a more difficult task is to identify anomalies that are both interesting and statistically significant. Category detection is an emerging area of machine learning that can help address this issue using a ""human-in-the-loop"" approach. In this interactive setting, the algorithm asks the user to label a query data point under an existing category or declare the query data point to belong to a previously undiscovered category. The goal of category detection is to bring to the user's attention a representative data point from each category in the data in as few queries as possible. In a data set with imbalanced categories, the main challenge is in identifying the rare categories or anomalies; hence, the task is often referred to as rare category detection. We present a new approach to rare category detection based on hierarchical mean shift. In our approach, a hierarchy is created by repeatedly applying mean shift with an increasing bandwidth on the data. This hierarchy allows us to identify anomalies in the data set at different scales, which are then posed as queries to the user. The main advantage of this methodology over existing approaches is that it does not require any knowledge of the dataset properties such as the total number of categories or the prior probabilities of the categories. Results on real-world data sets show that our hierarchical mean shift approach performs consistently better than previous techniques.",KDD
Fast Vehicle Identification in Surveillance via Ranked Semantic Sampling Based Embedding,2018,"Identifying vehicles across cameras in traffic surveillance is fundamentally important for public safety purposes. However, despite some preliminary work, the rapid vehicle search in large-scale datasets has not been investigated. Moreover, modelling a view-invariant similarity between vehicle images from different views is still highly challenging. To address the problems, in this paper, we propose a Ranked Semantic Sampling (RSS) guided binary embedding method for fast cross-view vehicle Re-IDentification (Re-ID). The search can be conducted by efficiently computing similarities in the projected space. Unlike previous methods using random sampling, we design tree-structured attributes to guide the mini-batch sampling. The ranked pairs of hard samples in the mini-batch can improve the convergence of optimization. By minimizing a novel ranked semantic distance loss defined according to the structure, the learned Hamming distance is view-invariant, which enables cross-view Re-ID. The experimental results demonstrate that RSS outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches and the learned embedding from one dataset can be transferred to achieve the task of vehicle Re-ID on another dataset.",IJCAI
TINET: Learning Invariant Networks via Knowledge Transfer,2018,"The latent behavior of an information system that can exhibit extreme events, such as system faults or cyber-attacks, is complex. Recently, the invariant network has shown to be a powerful way of characterizing complex system behaviors. Structures and evolutions of the invariance network, in particular, the vanishing correlations, can shed light on identifying causal anomalies and performing system diagnosis. However, due to the dynamic and complex nature of real-world information systems, learning a reliable invariant network in a new environment often requires continuous collecting and analyzing the system surveillance data for several weeks or even months. Although the invariant networks learned from old environments have some common entities and entity relationships, these networks cannot be directly borrowed for the new environment due to the domain variety problem. To avoid the prohibitive time and resource consuming network building process, we propose TINET, a knowledge transfer based model for accelerating invariant network construction. In particular, we first propose an entity estimation model to estimate the probability of each source domain entity that can be included in the final invariant network of the target domain. Then, we propose a dependency construction model for constructing the unbiased dependency relationships by solving a two-constraint optimization problem. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of TINET. We also apply TINET to a real enterprise security system for intrusion detection. TINET achieves superior detection performance at least 20 days lead-lag time in advance with more than 75% accuracy.",KDD
Detecting moving object outliers in massive-scale trajectory streams,2014,"The detection of abnormal moving objects over high-volume trajectory streams is critical for real time applications ranging from military surveillance to transportation management. Yet this problem remains largely unexplored.

Our theoretical analysis and empirical study on the Beijing Taxi and GMTI (Ground Moving Target Indicator) datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing abnormal moving objects. Furthermore we propose a general strategy for efficiently detecting the new outlier classes. It features three fundamental optimization principles designed to minimize the detection costs.

Although autonomous systems (AS) topology has been measured and modeled for many years, focusing primarily on economic relationships, earlier studies have not quantified how topology is changing with respect to nation-state boundaries. National boundaries are natural points of control for surveillance, censorship, tariffs and data localization. This paper introduces a measure, national choke-point potential (NCP), to characterize how a country's AS topology is organized in terms of BGP paths that can carry traffic across international borders. To study country-level chokepoints, we developed BGP-SAS, an open source, cross platform, efficient set of tools for simulating BGP routing and calculating national chokepoint measures. We use these tools to assess how AS topologies have changed over a ten-year span, finding significant variability among countries, with some increasing their chokepoint potential and others remaining constant, fluctuating, and in some cases declining. Overall, however, most national Internet boundaries have either become more pronounced or remained constant, despite new infrastructure buildouts and increased Internet usage. When compared to independent measures of Internet freedom, we find statistically significant relationships between NCP and Internet freedom.",COMPASS
DEFSI: Deep Learning Based Epidemic Forecasting with Synthetic Information,2019,"Influenza-like illness (ILI) is among the most common diseases worldwide. Producing timely, well-informed, and reliable forecasts for ILI is crucial for preparedness and optimal interventions. In this work, we focus on short-term but highresolution forecasting and propose DEFSI (Deep Learning Based Epidemic Forecasting with Synthetic Information), an epidemic forecasting framework that integrates the strengths of artificial neural networks and causal methods. In DEFSI, we build a two-branch neural network structure to take both within-season observations and between-season observations as features. The model is trained on geographically highresolution synthetic data. It enables detailed forecasting when high-resolution surveillance data is not available. Furthermore, the model is provided with better generalizability and physical consistency. Our method achieves comparable/better performance than state-of-the-art methods for short-term ILI forecasting at the state level. For high-resolution forecasting at the county level, DEFSI significantly outperforms the other methods.",AAAI
Coupled behavior analysis for capturing coupling relationships in group-based market manipulations,2012,"In stock markets, an emerging challenge for surveillance is that a group of hidden manipulators collaborate with each other to manipulate the price movement of securities. Recently, the coupled hidden Markov model (CHMM)-based coupled behavior analysis (CBA) has been proposed to consider the coupling relationships in the above group-based behaviors for manipulation detection. From the modeling perspective, however, this requires overall aggregation of the behavioral data to cater for the CHMM modeling, which does not differentiate the coupling relationships presented in different forms within the aggregated behaviors and degrade the capability for further anomaly detection. Thus, this paper suggests a general CBA framework for detecting group-based market manipulation by capturing more comprehensive couplings and proposes two variant implementations, which are hybrid coupling (HC)-based and hierarchical grouping (HG)-based respectively. The proposed framework consists of three stages. The first stage, qualitative analysis, generates possible qualitative coupling relationships between behaviors with or without domain knowledge. In the second stage, quantitative representation of coupled behaviors is learned via proper methods. For the third stage, anomaly detection algorithms are proposed to cater for different application scenarios. Experimental results on data from a major Asian stock market show that the proposed framework outperforms the CHMM-based analysis in terms of detecting abnormal collaborative market manipulations. Additionally, the two different implementations are compared with their effectiveness for different application scenarios.",KDD
Detecting abnormal coupled sequences and sequence changes in group-based manipulative trading behaviors,2010,"In capital market surveillance, an emerging trend is that a group of hidden manipulators collaborate with each other to manipulate three trading sequences: buy-orders, sell-orders and trades, through carefully arranging their prices, volumes and time, in order to mislead other investors, affect the instrument movement, and thus maximize personal benefits. If the focus is on only one of the above three sequences in attempting to analyze such hidden group based behavior, or if they are merged into one sequence as per an investor, the coupling relationships among them indicated through trading actions and their prices/volumes/times would be missing, and the resulting findings would have a high probability of mismatching the genuine fact in business. Therefore, typical sequence analysis approaches, which mainly identify patterns on a single sequence, cannot be used here. This paper addresses a novel topic, namely coupled behavior analysis in hidden groups. In particular, we propose a coupled Hidden Markov Models (HMM)-based approach to detect abnormal group-based trading behaviors. The resulting models cater for (1) multiple sequences from a group of people, (2) interactions among them, (3) sequence item properties, and (4) significant change among coupled sequences. We demonstrate our approach in detecting abnormal manipulative trading behaviors on orderbook-level stock data. The results are evaluated against alerts generated by the exchange's surveillance system from both technical and computational perspectives. It shows that the proposed coupled and adaptive HMMs outperform a standard HMM only modeling any single sequence, or the HMM combining multiple single sequences, without considering the coupling relationship. Further work on coupled behavior analysis, including coupled sequence/event analysis, hidden group analysis and behavior dynamics are very critical.",KDD
Surveillance of Parimutuel Wagering Integrity Using Expert Systems and Machine Learning,2010,"Parimutuel wagering is a significant source of revenue for many state governments. MonitorPlus is a surveillance system for parimutuel operators and regulators. Using industry expertise and best practices, MonitorPlus examines each and every wager and account transaction for evidence of fraud, crime, and money laundering. Alerts are generated in real-time. In forensic discovery mode, MonitorPlus is designed to collaborate with skilled analysts to discover more complex suspicious wagering patterns. MonitorPlus utilizes machine learning, so its risk profiles are current: its knowledge base improves with time. Each alert is accompanied by an automatically generated, rule-based explanation. This is critically important if an event rises to the level where legal action is required. Our development and deployment strategy is based on a new paradigm of a secure surveillance utility, where real-time alerts and dataintensive forensics support multiple regulatory jurisdictions. We believe this surveillance paradigm can be applied to other application domains such as lotteries, casinos, online gaming, and financial services.",AAAI
Covert Networks: How Hard is It to Hide? (Page 628),2019,"Covert networks are social networks that often consist of harmful users. Social Network Analysis (SNA) has played an important role in reducing criminal activities (e.g., counter terrorism) via detecting the influential users in such networks. There are various popular measures to quantify how influential or central any vertex is in a network. As expected, strategic and influential miscreants in covert networks would try to hide herself and her partners (called \em leaders ) from being detected via these measures by introducing new edges. Waniek et al. show that the corresponding computational problem, called Hiding Leader, is NP Complete for the degree and closeness centrality measures. We study the popular core centrality measure and show that the problem is NP Complete even when the core centrality of every leader is only 3. On the contrary, we prove that the problem becomes polynomial time solvable for the degree centrality measure if the degree of every leader is bounded above by any constant. We then focus on the optimization version of the problem and show that the Hiding Leader problem admits a 2 factor approximation algorithm for the degree centrality measure. We complement it by proving that one cannot hope to have any (2-epsilon) factor approximation algorithm for any constant $epsilon>0$ unless there is a epsilon/2 factor polynomial time algorithm for the Densest k-Subgraph problem which would be considered a significant breakthrough. We empirically establish that our 2 factor approximation algorithm frequently finds out a near optimal solution. On the contrary, for the core centrality measure, we show that the Hiding Leader problem does not admit any (1-alpha) ln n factor approximation algorithm for any constant alpha in (0,1) unless P=NP even when the core centrality of every leader is only 3. Hence, our work shows that, although classical complexity theoretic framework fails to shed any light on relative difficulty of Hiding Leader for different centrality measures, the problem is significantly ""harder'' for the core centrality measure than the degree centrality one.",AAMAS
Attacking Similarity-Based Link Prediction in Social Networks (Page 305),2019,"Link prediction is one of the fundamental problems in computational social science. A particularly common means to predict existence of unobserved links is via structural similarity metrics, such as the number of common neighbors; node pairs with higher similarity are thus deemed more likely to be linked. However, a number of applications of link prediction, such as predicting links in gang or terrorist networks, are adversarial, with another party incentivized to minimize its effectiveness by manipulating observed information about the network. We offer a comprehensive algorithmic investigation of the problem of attacking similarity-based link prediction through link deletion, focusing on two broad classes of such approaches, one which uses only local information about target links, and another which uses global network information. While we show several variations of the general problem to be NP-Hard for both local and global metrics, we exhibit a number of well-motivated special cases which are tractable. Additionally, we provide principled and empirically effective algorithms for the intractable cases, in some cases proving worst-case approximation guarantees.",AAMAS
Protecting Neural Networks with Hierarchical Random Switching: Towards Better Robustness-Accuracy Trade-off for Stochastic Defenses,2019,"Despite achieving remarkable success in various domains, recent studies have uncovered the vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial perturbations, creating concerns on model generalizability and new threats such as prediction-evasive misclassification or stealthy reprogramming. Among different defense proposals, stochastic network defenses such as random neuron activation pruning or random perturbation to layer inputs are shown to be promising for attack mitigation. However, one critical drawback of current defenses is that the robustness enhancement is at the cost of noticeable performance degradation on legitimate data, e.g., large drop in test accuracy.This paper is motivated by pursuing for a better trade-off between adversarial robustness and test accuracy for stochastic network defenses. We propose Defense Efficiency Score (DES), a comprehensive metric that measures the gain in unsuccessful attack attempts at the cost of drop in test accuracy of any defense. To achieve a better DES, we propose hierarchical random switching (HRS), which protects neural networks through a novel randomization scheme. A HRS-protected model contains several blocks of randomly switching channels to prevent adversaries from exploiting fixed model structures and parameters for their malicious purposes. Extensive experiments show that HRS is superior in defending against state-of-the-art white-box and adaptive adversarial misclassification attacks. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of HRS in defending adversarial reprogramming, which is the first defense against adversarial programs. Moreover, in most settings the average DES of HRS is at least 5X higher than current stochastic network defenses, validating its significantly improved robustness-accuracy trade-off.",IJCAI
HACKAR: Helpful Advice for Code Knowledge and Attack Resilience,2015,"This paper describes a novel combination of Java program analysis and automated learning and planning architecture to the domain of Java vulnerability analysis. The key feature of our ""HACKAR:Helpful Advice for Code Knowledge and Attack Resilience'' system is its ability to analyze Java programs at development-time, identifying vulnerabilities and ways to avoid them. HACKAR uses an improved version of NASA's Java PathFinder (JPF) to execute Java programs and identify vulnerabilities. The system features new Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) learning algorithms that (1) advance state-of-the-art HTN learners with reasoning about numeric constraints, failures, and more general cases of recursion, and (2) contribute to problem-solving by learning a hierarchical dataflow representation of the program from the inputs of the program. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that HACKAR was able to suggest fixes for all of our test program suites.

Infrastructure Resilience for Climate Adaptation,2018,"Developing and maintaining resilient transportation infrastructure is a key strategy for meeting several UN sustainable development goals in the face of climate change-driven extreme flooding events. We present a framework for performing data-driven vulnerability analysis for flooding on existing transportation networks, and use this analysis to inform decision-making about investments for climate adaptation. We apply this approach to study the potential impacts of severe flooding on regional mobility in Senegal, using a combination of flood hazard maps and a travel demand model based on call detail record data. We use the estimated number of infeasible trips as a direct measure of flooding-induced mobility impacts, as well as an objective for minimizing these impacts. We then compare three alternative road network upgrade strategies to assess the extent to which each strategy would preserve network functionality under a given flooding scenario. We illustrate that strategies driven solely by travel demand can lead to underinvestment in roads that are at risk of flooding, while solely focusing on repairing flooded road segments neglects the criticality of those repairs to mobility. For example, in a 100 year flooding scenario with a fixed budget, our strategy that considers both flooding and mobility data can achieve a 53% reduction in the number of infeasible trips, while a strategy that just considers flooding data achieves only a 38% reduction for the same cost. Our framework can be applied more broadly to integrate information from a variety of sources about climate hazards and potential human impacts to make better informed decisions about investments in critical infrastructure systems.",COMPASS
Reinforcement Learning for Vulnerability Assessment in Peer-to-Peer Networks,2008,"Proactive assessment of computer-network vulnerability to unknown future attacks is an important but unsolved computer security problem where AI techniques have significant impact potential. In this paper, we investigate the use of reinforcement learning (RL) for proactive security in the context of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. Such a tool would be useful for network administrators and designers to assess and compare the vulnerability of various network configurations and security measures in order to optimize those choices for maximum security. We first discuss the various dimensions of the problem and how to formulate it as RL. Next we introduce compact parametric policy representations for both single attacker and botnets and derive a policy-gradient RL algorithm. We evaluate these algorithms under a variety of network configurations that employ recent fair-use DoS security mechanisms. The results show that our RL-based approach is able to significantly outperform a number of heuristic strategies in terms of the severity of the attacks discovered. The results also suggest some possible network design lessons for reducing the attack potential of an intelligent attacker.",AAAI
Precipitation Nowcasting with Satellite Imagery,2019,"Precipitation nowcasting is a short-range forecast of rain/snow (up to 2 hours), often displayed on top of the geographical map by the weather service. Modern precipitation nowcasting algorithms rely on the extrapolation of observations by ground-based radars via optical flow techniques or neural network models. Dependent on these radars, typical nowcasting is limited to the regions around their locations. We have developed a method for precipitation nowcasting based on geostationary satellite imagery and incorporated the resulting data into the Yandex.Weather precipitation map (including an alerting service with push notifications for products in the Yandex ecosystem), thus expanding its coverage and paving the way to a truly global nowcasting service.",KDD
K-margin-based Residual-Convolution-Recurrent Neural Network for Atrial Fibrillation Detection,2019,"Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is an abnormal heart rhythm which can trigger cardiac arrest and sudden death. Nevertheless, its interpretation is mostly done by medical experts due to high error rates of computerized interpretation. One study found that only about 66% of AF were correctly recognized from noisy ECGs. This is in part due to insufficient training data, class skewness, as well as semantical ambiguities caused by noisy segments in an ECG record. In this paper, we propose a K-margin-based Residual-Convolution-Recurrent neural network (K-margin-based RCR-net) for AF detection from noisy ECGs. In detail, a skewness-driven dynamic augmentation method is employed to handle the problems of data inadequacy and class imbalance. A novel RCR-net is proposed to automatically extract both long-term rhythm-level and local heartbeat-level characters. Finally, we present a K-margin-based diagnosis model to automatically focus on the most important parts of an ECG record and handle noise by naturally exploiting expected consistency among the segments associated for each record. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method with 0.8125 F1NAOP score outperforms all state-of-the-art deep learning methods for AF detection task by 6.8%.",IJCAI
Facets: Fast Comprehensive Mining of Coevolving High-order Time Series,2015,"Mining time series data has been a very active research area in the past decade, exactly because of its prevalence in many high-impact applications, ranging from environmental monitoring, intelligent transportation systems, computer network forensics, to smart buildings and many more. It has posed many fascinating research questions. Among others, three prominent challenges shared by a variety of real applications are (a) high-order; (b) contextual constraints and (c) temporal smoothness. The state-of-the-art mining algorithms are rich in addressing each of these challenges, but relatively short of comprehensiveness in attacking the coexistence of multiple or even all of these three challenges.
 In this paper, we propose a comprehensive method, FACETS, to simultaneously model all these three challenges. We formulate it as an optimization problem from a dynamic graphical model perspective. The key idea is to use tensor factorization to address multi-aspect challenges, and perform careful regularizations to attack both contextual and temporal challenges. Based on that, we propose an effective and scalable algorithm to solve the problem. Our experimental evaluations on three real datasets demonstrate that our method (1) outperforms its competitors in two common data mining tasks (imputation and prediction); and (2) enjoys a linear scalability w.r.t. the length of time series.",KDD
Coordinating Measurements for Air Pollution Monitoring in Participatory Sensing Settings (Page 493),2015,"Environmental monitoring is important, as it allows authorities to understand the impact of potentially harmful environmental phenomena, such as air pollution, noise or temperature, on public health. To achieve this effectively, participatory sensing is a promising paradigm for large-scale data collection. In this approach, ordinary citizens (non-expert contributors) collect environmental data using low-cost mobile devices. However, these participants are generally self-interested agents having their own goals and making local decisions about where and when to take measurements, if any at all. This can lead to a highly inefficient outcome, where observations are either taken redundantly or do not provide sufficient information about key areas of interest. To address these challenges, a coordination system is necessary to guide and to coordinate participants. This paper proposes such a participatory sensing framework and presents a novel algorithm based on entropy and mutual information criteria, called Local Greedy Search (LGS), that takes into consideration knowledge about human mobility patterns and the inconvenience cost that is incurred by taking measurements. In particular, the algorithm uses a local search technique to map participants to measurements that need to be taken. We empirically evaluate our algorithm on real-world human mobility and air quality data and show that our coordination algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art greedy and myopic algorithms. In particular, LGS gains 33.4% more information than the best benchmark in realistic city-scale scenarios with hundreds of agents.",AAMAS
Proactive workflow modeling by stochastic processes with application to healthcare operation and management,2014,"Advances in real-time location system (RTLS) solutions have enabled us to collect massive amounts of fine-grained semantically rich location traces, which provide unparalleled opportunities for understanding human activities and discovering useful knowledge. This, in turn, delivers intelligence for real-time decision making in various fields, such as workflow management. Indeed, it is a new paradigm for workflow modeling by the knowledge discovery in location traces. To that end, in this paper, we provide a focused study of workflow modeling by the integrated analysis of indoor location traces in the hospital environment. In comparison with conventional workflow modeling based on passive workflow logs, one salient feature of our approach is that it can proactively unravel the workflow patterns hidden in the location traces, by automatically constructing the workflow states and estimating parameters describing the transition patterns of moving objects. Specifically, to determine a meaningful granularity for the model, the workflow states are first constructed as regions associated with specific healthcare activities. Then, we transform the original indoor location traces to the sequences of workflow states and model the workflow transition patterns by finite state machines. Furthermore, we leverage the correlations in the location traces between related types of medical devices to reinforce the modeling performance and enable more applications. The results show that the proposed framework can not only model the workflow patterns effectively, but also have managerial applications in workflow monitoring, auditing, and inspection of workflow compliance, which are critical in the healthcare industry.",KDD
Nonstationary Gaussian Process Regression for Evaluating Repeated Clinical Laboratory Tests,2015,"Sampling repeated clinical laboratory tests with appropriate timing is challenging because the latent physiologic function being sampled is in general nonstationary. When ordering repeated tests, clinicians adopt various simple strategies that may or may not be well suited to the behavior of the function. Previous research on this topic has been primarily focused on cost-driven assessments of oversampling. But for monitoring physiologic state or for retrospective analysis, undersampling can be much more problematic than oversampling. In this paper we analyze hundreds of observation sequences of four different clinical laboratory tests to provide principled, data-driven estimates of undersampling and oversampling, and to assess whether the sampling adapts to changing volatility of the latent function. To do this, we developed a new method for fitting a Gaussian process to samples of a nonstationary latent function. Our method includes an explicit estimate of the latent function's volatility over time, which is deterministically related to its nonstationarity. We find on average that the degree of undersampling is up to an order of magnitude greater than oversampling, and that only a small minority are sampled with an adaptive strategy.",AAAI
Detection of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation using Attention-based Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks,2018,"Detection of atrial fibrillation (AF), a type of cardiac arrhythmia, is difficult since many cases of AF are usually clinically silent and undiagnosed. In particular paroxysmal AF is a form of AF that occurs occasionally, and has a higher probability of being undetected. In this work, we present an attention based deep learning framework for detection of paroxysmal AF episodes from a sequence of windows. Time-frequency representation of 30 seconds recording windows, over a 10 minute data segment, are fed sequentially into a deep convolutional neural network for image-based feature extraction, which are then presented to a bidirectional recurrent neural network with an attention layer for AF detection. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for transient AF detection, we use a database of 24 hour Holter Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings acquired from 2850 patients at the University of Virginia heart station. The algorithm achieves an AUC of 0.94 on the testing set, which exceeds the performance of baseline models. We also demonstrate the cross-domain generalizablity of the approach by adapting the learned model parameters from one recording modality (ECG) to another (photoplethysmogram) with improved AF detection performance. The proposed high accuracy, low false alarm algorithm for detecting paroxysmal AF has potential applications in long-term monitoring using wearable sensors.",KDD
Early Prediction of Coronary Artery Calcification Levels Using Machine Learning,2013,"Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a major cause of death worldwide.In the U.S. CHD is responsible for approximated 1 in every 6 deaths with a coronary event occurring every 25 seconds and about 1 death every minute based on data current to 2007.Although a multitude of cardiovascular risks factors have been identified, CHD actually reflects complexinteractions of these factors over time. Today's datasets from longitudinal studies offer great promise to uncover these interactions but also pose enormous analytical problems due to typically large amount of both discrete and continuous measurements and risk factors with potential long-range interactions over time.Our investigation demonstrates that a statistical relational analysis of longitudinal data can easily uncover complex interactions of risks factors and actually predict future coronary artery calcification (CAC) levels --- an indicator of the risk of CHD present subclinically in an individual --- significantly better than traditional non-relational approaches.The uncovered long-range interactions between risk factors conform to existing clinical knowledgeand are successful in identifying risk factors at the early adult stage. This may contribute to monitoring young adults via smartphones and to designing patient-specific treatments in young adults to mitigate their risk later.",AAAI
TATC: Predicting Alzheimer's Disease with Actigraphy Data,2018,"With the increase of elderly population, Alzheimer's Disease (AD), as the most common cause of dementia among the elderly, is affecting more and more senior people. It is crucial for a patient to receive accurate and timely diagnosis of AD. Current diagnosis relies on doctors' experience and clinical test, which, unfortunately, may not be performed until noticeable AD symptoms are developed. In this work, we present our novel solution named time-aware TICC and CNN (TATC), for predicting AD from actigraphy data. TATC is a multivariate time series classification method using a neural attention-based deep learning approach. It not only performs accurate prediction of AD risk, but also generates meaningful interpretation of daily behavior pattern of subjects.

We believe the future deployment of TATC can benefit both doctors and patients in early detection of potential AD risk.",KDD
Learning Diffusions without Timestamps,2019,"To learn the underlying parent-child influence relationships between nodes in a diffusion network, most existing approaches require timestamps that pinpoint the exact time when node infections occur in historical diffusion processes. In many real-world diffusion processes like the spread of epidemics, monitoring such infection temporal information is often expensive and difficult. In this work, we study how to carry out diffusion network inference without infection timestamps, using only the final infection statuses of nodes in each historical diffusion process, which are more readily accessible in practice. Our main result is a probabilistic model that can find for each node an appropriate number of most probable parent nodes, who are most likely to have generated the historical infection results of the node. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks are conducted, and the results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.",AAAI
EpiDeep: Exploiting Embeddings for Epidemic Forecasting,2019,"Influenza leads to regular losses of lives annually and requires careful monitoring and control by health organizations. Annual influenza forecasts help policymakers implement effective countermeasures to control both seasonal and pandemic outbreaks. Existing forecasting techniques suffer from problems such as poor forecasting performance, lack of modeling flexibility, data sparsity, and/or lack of intepretability. We propose EpiDeep, a novel deep neural network approach for epidemic forecasting which tackles all of these issues by learning meaningful representations of incidence curves in a continuous feature space and accurately predicting future incidences, peak intensity, peak time, and onset of the upcoming season. We present extensive experiments on forecasting ILI (influenza-like illnesses) in the United States, leveraging multiple metrics to quantify success. Our results demonstrate that EpiDeep is successful at learning meaningful embeddings and, more importantly, that these embeddings evolve as the season progresses. Furthermore, our approach outperforms non-trivial baselines by up to 40%.",KDD
A Smart Range Helping Cognitively-Impaired Persons Cooking,2014,"People suffering from a loss of autonomy caused by a cognitive deficit generally have to perform important daily tasks (such as cooking) using devices and appliances designed for healthy people, which do not take into consideration their cognitive impairment. Using these devices is risky and may lead to a tragedy (e.g. fire). A potential solution to this issue is to provide automated systems, which perform tasks on behalf of the patient. However, clinical studies have shown that encouraging users to maintain their autonomy greatly help to preserve health, dignity, and motivation. Therefore, we present in this paper a new smart range prototype allowing monitoring and guiding a cognitively-impaired user in the activity of preparing a meal. This new original prototype is capable of giving adapted prompting to the user in the completion of several recipes by exploiting load cells, heat sensors and electromagnetic contacts embedded in the range.

Outstanding student paper: A Hidden Markov Model-Based Cicada Detector for Crowdsourced Smartphone Biodiversity Monitoring,2013,"Automated acoustic recognition of species aims to provide a cost-effective method for biodiversity monitoring. This is particularly appealing for detecting endangered animals with a distinctive call, such as the New Forest cicada. To this end, we pursue a crowdsourcing approach, whereby the millions of visitors to the New Forest will help to monitor the presence of this cicada by means of a smartphone app that can detect its mating call. However, current systems for acoustic insect classification are aimed at batch processing and not suited to a real-time approach as required by this system, because they are too computationally expensive and not robust to environmental noise. To address this shortcoming we propose a novel insect detection algorithm based on a hidden Markov model to which we feed as a single feature vector the ratio of two key frequencies extracted through the Goertzel algorithm. Our results show that this novel approach, compared to the state of the art for batch insect classification, is much more robust to noise while also reducing the computational cost.",IJCAI
A Novel and Scalable Spatio-Temporal Technique for Ocean Eddy Monitoring,2012,"Swirls of ocean currents known as ocean eddies are a crucial component of the ocean's dynamics. In addition to dominating the ocean's kinetic energy, eddies play a significant role in the transport of water, salt, heat, and nutrients. Therefore, understanding current and future eddy patterns is a central climate challenge to address future sustainability of marine ecosystems. The emergence of sea surface height observations from satellite radar altimeter has recently enabled researchers to track eddies at a global scale. The majority of studies that identify eddies from observational data employ highly parametrized connected component algorithms using expert filtered data, effectively making reproducibility and scalability challenging. In this paper, we frame the challenge of monitoring ocean eddies as an unsupervised learning problem. We present a novel change detection algorithm that automatically identifies and monitors eddies in sea surface height data based on heuristics derived from basic eddy properties. Our method is accurate, efficient, and scalable. To demonstrate its performance we analyze eddy activity in the Nordic Sea (60-80N and 20W-20E), an area that has received limited attention and has proven to be difficult to analyze using other methods.",AAAI
Sequence-to-Point Learning with Neural Networks for Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring,2018,"Energy disaggregation (a.k.a nonintrusive load monitoring, NILM), a single-channel blind source separation problem, aims to decompose the mains which records the whole house electricity consumption into appliance-wise readings. This problem is difficult because it is inherently unidentifiable. Recent approaches have shown that the identifiability problem could be reduced by introducing domain knowledge into the model. Deep neural networks have been shown to be a promising approach for these problems, but sliding windows are necessary to handle the long sequences which arise in signal processing problems, which raises issues about how to combine predictions from different sliding windows. In this paper, we propose sequence-to-point learning, where the input is a window of the mains and the output is a single point of the target appliance. We use convolutional neural networks to train the model. Interestingly, we systematically show that the convolutional neural networks can inherently learn the signatures of the target appliances, which are automatically added into the model to reduce the identifiability problem. We applied the proposed neural network approaches to real-world household energy data, and show that the methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, improving two standard error measures by 84% and 92%.",AAAI
Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring Using Prior Models of General Appliance Types,2012,"Non-intrusive appliance load monitoring is the process of disaggregating a household's total electricity consumption into its contributing appliances. In this paper we propose an approach by which individual appliances can be iteratively separated from an aggregate load. Unlike existing approaches, our approach does not require training data to be collected by sub-metering individual appliances, nor does it assume complete knowledge of the appliances present in the household. Instead, we propose an approach in which prior models of general appliance types are tuned to specific appliance instances using only signatures extracted from the aggregate load. The tuned appliance models are then used to estimate each appliance's load, which is subsequently subtracted from the aggregate load. This process is applied iteratively until all appliances for which prior behaviour models are known have been disaggregated. We evaluate the accuracy of our approach using the REDD data set, and show the disaggregation performance when using our training approach is comparable to when sub-metered training data is used. We also present a deployment of our system as a live application and demonstrate the potential for personalised energy saving feedback.",AAAI
Following the electrons: methods for power management in commercial buildings,2012,"Commercial buildings are significant consumers of electricity. The first step towards better energy management in commercial buildings is monitoring consumption. However, instrumenting every electrical panel in a large commercial building is expensive and wasteful. In this paper, we propose a greedy meter (sensor) placement algorithm based on maximization of information gained, subject to a cost constraint. The algorithm provides a near-optimal solution guarantee. Furthermore, to identify power saving opportunities, we use an unsupervised anomaly detection technique based on a low-dimensional embedding. Further, to better manage resources such as lighting and HVAC, we propose a semi-supervised approach combining hidden Markov models (HMM) and a standard classifier to model occupancy based on readily available port-level network statistics.",KDD
Subtask Gated Networks for Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring,2019,"Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), also known as energy disaggregation, is a blind source separation problem where a householdÃ¢â¬â¢s aggregate electricity consumption is broken down into electricity usages of individual appliances. In this way, the cost and trouble of installing many measurement devices over numerous household appliances can be avoided, and only one device needs to be installed. The problem has been well-known since HartÃ¢â¬â¢s seminal paper in 1992, and recently significant performance improvements have been achieved by adopting deep networks. In this work, we focus on the idea that appliances have on/off states, and develop a deep network for further performance improvements. Specifically, we propose a subtask gated network that combines the main regression network with an on/off classification subtask network. Unlike typical multitask learning algorithms where multiple tasks simply share the network parameters to take advantage of the relevance among tasks, the subtask gated network multiply the main networkÃ¢â¬â¢s regression output with the subtaskÃ¢â¬â¢s classification probability. When standby-power is additionally learned, the proposed solution surpasses the state-of-the-art performance for most of the benchmark cases.

MOMDPs: A Solution for Modelling Adaptive Management Problems,2012,"In conservation biology and natural resource management, adaptive management is an iterative process of improving management by reducing uncertainty via monitoring. Adaptive management is the principal tool for conserving endangered species under global change, yet adaptive management problems suffer from a poor suite of solution methods. The common approach used to solve an adaptive management problem is to assume the system state is known and the system dynamics can be one of a set of pre-defined models. The solution method used is unsatisfactory, employing value iteration on a discretized belief MDP which restricts the study to very small problems. We show how to overcome this limitation by modelling an adaptive management problem as a restricted Mixed Observability MDP called hidden model MDP (hmMDP). We demonstrate how to simplify the value function, the backup operator and the belief update computation. We show that, although a simplified case of POMDPs, hm-MDPs are PSPACE-complete in the finite-horizon case. We illustrate the use of this model to manage a population of the threatened Gouldian finch, a bird species endemic to Northern Australia. Our simple modelling approach is an important step towards efficient algorithms for solving adaptive management problems.",AAAI
Timed Probabilistic Automaton: A Bridge between Raven and Song Scope for Automatic Species Recognition,2013,"Raven and Song Scope are two state-of-the-art automated sound analysis tools based on machine learning techniques for environmental monitoring. Many research works have been conducted upon them, however, no or rare exploration mentions about the performance and comparison between them. This paper compares the tools from six aspects: theory, software interface, ease of use, detection targets, detection accuracy, and potential applications. Through deep exploration one critical gap is identified that there is a lack of approach to detect both syllables and call structures, since Raven only aims to detect syllables while Song Scope targets call structures. Therefore, a Timed Probabilistic Automata (TPA) system is proposed which separates syllables and clusters them into complex structures.",AAAI
Estimation of Human Internal Temperature from Wearable Physiological Sensors,2010,"We evaluated a Kalman filter (KF) approach to modeling the physiology of internal temperature viewed through Ã¢â¬ÅnoisyÃ¢â¬Â non-invasive observations of heart rate. Human core body temperature (Tcore) is an important measure of thermal state, e.g., hypo- or hyperthermia, but is difficult to measure using non-invasive wearable sensors. We estimated parameters for a discrete KF model from data collected during several Military training events and from distance runners (n=38). Model performance was evaluated in 25 physically-active subjects who participated in various laboratory and field studies involving exercise of 2-to-8 h duration at ambient temperatures of 20 to 40ÃÂ°C. Overall, the KF modelÃ¢â¬â¢s estimate of Tcore had a root mean square error of 0.30ÃÂ±0.13 ÃÂºC from the observed Tcore, and was within ÃÂ± 0.5 ÃÂºC over 85% of the time. The benefit of the KF approach is that it requires only one input while current state of the art models typically require multiple inputs including individual anthropometrics, metabolic rate, clothing characteristics, and environmental conditions. This state estimation problem in computational physiology illustrates the potential for collaboration between the artificial intelligence and ambulatory physiological monitoring communities.",AAAI
Incremental Dual-memory LSTM in Land Cover Prediction,2017,"Land cover prediction is essential for monitoring global environmental change. Unfortunately, traditional classification models are plagued by temporal variation and emergence of novel/unseen land cover classes in the prediction process. In this paper, we propose an LSTM-based spatio-temporal learning framework with a dual-memory structure. The dual-memory structure captures both long-term and short-term temporal variation patterns, and is updated incrementally to adapt the model to the ever-changing environment. Moreover, we integrate zero-shot learning to identify unseen classes even without labelled samples. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over multiple baselines in land cover prediction.",KDD
A Nonparametric Online Model for Air Quality Prediction,2015,"We introduce a novel method for the continuous online prediction of particulate matter in the air (more specifically, PM10 and PM2.5) given sparse sensor information. A nonparametric model is developed using Gaussian Processes, which eschews the need for an explicit formulation of internal -- and usually very complex -- dependencies between meteorological variables. Instead, it uses historical data to extrapolate pollutant values both spatially (in areas with no sensor information) and temporally (the near future). Each prediction also contains a respective variance, indicating its uncertainty level and thus allowing a probabilistic treatment of results. A novel training methodology (Structural Cross-Validation) is presented, which preserves the spatio-temporal structure of available data during the hyperparameter optimization process. Tests were conducted using a real-time feed from a sensor network in an area of roughly 50x80 km, alongside comparisons with other techniques for air pollution prediction. The promising results motivated the development of a smartphone applicative and a website, currently in use to increase the efficiency of air quality monitoring and control in the area.",AAAI
AccuAir: Winning Solution to Air Quality Prediction for KDD Cup 2018,2019,"Since air pollution seriously affects human heath and daily life, the air quality prediction has attracted increasing attention and become an active and important research topic. In this paper, we present AccuAir, our winning solution to the KDD Cup 2018 of Fresh Air, where the proposed solution has won the 1st place in two tracks, and the 2nd place in the other one. Our solution got the best accuracy on average in all the evaluation days. The task is to accurately predict the air quality (as indicated by the concentration of PM2.5, PM10 or O3) of the next 48 hours for each monitoring station in Beijing and London. Aiming at a cutting-edge solution, we first presents an analysis of the air quality data, identifying the fundamental challenges, such as the long-term but suddenly changing air quality, and complex spatial-temporal correlations in different stations. To address the challenges, we carefully design both global and local air quality features, and develop three prediction models including LightGBM, Gated-DNN and Seq2Seq, each with novel ingredients developed for better solving the problem. Specifically, a spatial-temporal gate is proposed in our Gated-DNN model, to effectively capture the spatial-temporal correlations as well as temporal relatedness, making the prediction more sensitive to spatial and temporal signals. In addition, the Seq2Seq model is adapted in such a way that the encoder summarizes useful historical features while the decoder concatenate weather forecast as input, which significantly improves prediction accuracy. Assembling all these components together, the ensemble of three models outperforms all competing methods in terms of the prediction accuracy of 31 days average, 10 days average and 24-48 hours.",KDD
Deep Distributed Fusion Network for Air Quality Prediction,2018,"Accompanying the rapid urbanization, many developing countries are suffering from serious air pollution problem. The demand for predicting future air quality is becoming increasingly more important to government's policy-making and people's decision making. In this paper, we predict the air quality of next 48 hours for each monitoring station, considering air quality data, meteorology data, and weather forecast data. Based on the domain knowledge about air pollution, we propose a deep neural network (DNN)-based approach (entitled DeepAir), which consists of a spatial transformation component and a deep distributed fusion network. Considering air pollutants' spatial correlations, the former component converts the spatial sparse air quality data into a consistent input to simulate the pollutant sources. The latter network adopts a neural distributed architecture to fuse heterogeneous urban data for simultaneously capturing the factors affecting air quality, e.g. meteorological conditions. We deployed DeepAir in our AirPollutionPrediction system, providing fine-grained air quality forecasts for 300+ Chinese cities every hour. The experimental results on the data from three-year nine Chinese-city demonstrate the advantages of DeepAir beyond 10 baseline methods. Comparing with the previous online approach in AirPollutionPrediction system, we have 2.4%, 12.2%, 63.2% relative accuracy improvements on short-term, long-term and sudden changes prediction, respectively.",KDD
An integrated data mining approach to real-time clinical monitoring and deterioration warning,2012,"Clinical study found that early detection and intervention are essential for preventing clinical deterioration in patients, for patients both in intensive care units (ICU) as well as in general wards but under real-time data sensing (RDS). In this paper, we develop an integrated data mining approach to give early deterioration warnings for patients under real-time monitoring in ICU and RDS.
 Existing work on mining real-time clinical data often focus on certain single vital sign and specific disease. In this paper, we consider an integrated data mining approach for general sudden deterioration warning. We synthesize a large feature set that includes first and second order time-series features, detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), spectral analysis, approximative entropy, and cross-signal features. We then systematically apply and evaluate a series of established data mining methods, including forward feature selection, linear and nonlinear classification algorithms, and exploratory undersampling for class imbalance.
 An extensive empirical study is conducted on real patient data collected between 2001 and 2008 from a variety of ICUs. Results show the benefit of each of the proposed techniques, and the final integrated approach significantly improves the prediction quality. The proposed clinical warning system is currently under integration with the electronic medical record system at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in preparation for a clinical trial. This work represents a promising step toward general early clinical warning which has the potential to significantly improve the quality of patient care in hospitals.",KDD
AI-powered Posture Training: Application of Machine Learning in Sitting Posture Recognition Using the LifeChair Smart Cushion,2019,"Humans spend on average more than half of their day sitting down. The ill-effects of poor sitting posture and prolonged sitting on physical and mental health have been extensively studied, and solutions for curbing this sedentary epidemic have received special attention in recent years. With the recent advances in sensing technologies and Artificial Intelligence (AI), sitting posture monitoring and correction is one of the key problems to address for enhancing human well-being using AI. We present the application of a sitting posture training smart cushion called LifeChair that combines a novel pressure sensing technology, a smartphone app interface and machine learning (ML) for real-time sitting posture recognition and seated stretching guidance. We present our experimental design for sitting posture and stretch pose data collection using our posture training system. We achieved an accuracy of 98.93% in detecting more than 13 different sitting postures using a fast and robust supervised learning algorithm. We also establish the importance of taking into account the divergence in user body mass index in posture monitoring. Additionally, we present the first ML-based human stretch pose recognition system for pressure sensor data and show its performance in classifying six common chair-bound stretches.",IJCAI
Developing Measures of Cognitive Impairment in the Real World from Consumer-Grade Multimodal Sensor Streams,2019,"The ubiquity and remarkable technological progress of wearable consumer devices and mobile-computing platforms (smart phone, smart watch, tablet), along with the multitude of sensor modalities available, have enabled continuous monitoring of patients and their daily activities. Such rich, longitudinal information can be mined for physiological and behavioral signatures of cognitive impairment and provide new avenues for detecting MCI in a timely and cost-effective manner. In this work, we present a platform for remote and unobtrusive monitoring of symptoms related to cognitive impairment using several consumer-grade smart devices. We demonstrate how the platform has been used to collect a total of 16TB of data during the Lilly Exploratory Digital Assessment Study, a 12-week feasibility study which monitored 31 people with cognitive impairment and 82 without cognitive impairment in free living conditions. We describe how careful data unification, time-alignment, and imputation techniques can handle missing data rates inherent in real-world settings and ultimately show utility of these disparate data in differentiating symptomatics from healthy controls based on features computed purely from device data.",KDD
Learning Non-Stationary Space-Time Models for Environmental Monitoring,2012,"One of the primary aspects of sustainable development involves accurate understanding and modeling of environmental phenomena. Many of these phenomena exhibit variations in both space and time and it is imperative to develop a deeper understanding of techniques that can model space-time dynamics accurately. In this paper we propose NOSTILL-GP - NOn-stationary Space TIme variable Latent Length scale GP, a generic non-stationary, spatio-temporal Gaussian Process (GP) model. We present several strategies, for efficient training of our model, necessary for real-world applicability. Extensive empirical validation is performed using three real-world environmental monitoring datasets, with diverse dynamics across space and time. Results from the experiments clearly demonstrate general applicability and effectiveness of our approach for applications in environmental monitoring.",AAAI
A Neural Attention Model for Urban Air Quality Inference: Learning the Weights of Monitoring Stations,2018,"Urban air pollution has attracted much attention these years for its adverse impacts on human health. While monitoring stations have been established to collect pollutant statistics, the number of stations is very limited due to the high cost. Thus, inferring fine-grained urban air quality information is becoming an essential issue for both government and people. In this paper, we propose a generic neural approach, named ADAIN, for urban air quality inference. We leverage both the information from monitoring stations and urban data that are closely related to air quality, including POIs, road networks and meteorology. ADAIN combines feedforward and recurrent neural networks for modeling static and sequential features as well as capturing deep feature interactions effectively. A novel attempt of ADAIN is an attention-based pooling layer that automatically learns the weights of features from different monitoring stations, to boost the performance. We conduct experiments on a real-world air quality dataset and our approach achieves the highest performance compared with various state-of-the-art solutions.",AAAI
RainMon: an integrated approach to mining bursty timeseries monitoring data,2012,"Metrics like disk activity and network traffic are widespread sources of diagnosis and monitoring information in datacenters and networks. However, as the scale of these systems increases, examining the raw data yields diminishing insight. We present RainMon, a novel end-to-end approach for mining timeseries monitoring data designed to handle its size and unique characteristics. Our system is able to (a) mine large, bursty, real-world monitoring data, (b) find significant trends and anomalies in the data, (c) compress the raw data effectively, and (d) estimate trends to make forecasts. Furthermore, RainMon integrates the full analysis process from data storage to the user interface to provide accessible long-term diagnosis. We apply RainMon to three real-world datasets from production systems and show its utility in discovering anomalous machines and time periods.",KDD
RAIM: Recurrent Attentive and Intensive Model of Multimodal Patient Monitoring Data,2018,"With the improvement of medical data capturing, vast amount of continuous patient monitoring data, e.g., electrocardiogram (ECG), real-time vital signs and medications, become available for clinical decision support at intensive care units (ICUs). However, it becomes increasingly challenging to model such data, due to high density of the monitoring data, heterogeneous data types and the requirement for interpretable models.
 Integration of these high-density monitoring data with the discrete clinical events (including diagnosis, medications, labs) is challenging but potentially rewarding since richness and granularity in such multimodal data increase the possibilities for accurate detection of complex problems and predicting outcomes (e.g., length of stay and mortality). We propose Recurrent Attentive and Intensive Model (RAIM) for jointly analyzing continuous monitoring data and discrete clinical events. RAIM introduces an efficient attention mechanism for continuous monitoring data (e.g., ECG), which is guided by discrete clinical events (e.g, medication usage). We apply RAIM in predicting physiological decompensation and length of stay in those critically ill patients at ICU. With evaluations on MIMIC-III Waveform Database Matched Subset, we obtain an AUC-ROC score of $90.18%$ for predicting decompensation and an accuracy of $86.82%$ for forecasting length of stay with our final model, which outperforms our six baseline models.",KDD
Automatic Detection and Compression for Passive Acoustic Monitoring of the African Forest Elephant,2019,"In this work, we consider applying machine learning to the analysis and compression of audio signals in the context of monitoring elephants in sub-Saharan Africa. EarthÃ¢â¬â¢s biodiversity is increasingly under threat by sources of anthropogenic change (e.g. resource extraction, land use change, and climate change) and surveying animal populations is critical for developing conservation strategies. However, manually monitoring tropical forests or deep oceans is intractable. For species that communicate acoustically, researchers have argued for placing audio recorders in the habitats as a costeffective and non-invasive method, a strategy known as passive acoustic monitoring (PAM). In collaboration with conservation efforts, we construct a large labeled dataset of passive acoustic recordings of the African Forest Elephant via crowdsourcing, compromising thousands of hours of recordings in the wild. Using state-of-the-art techniques in artificial intelligence we improve upon previously proposed methods for passive acoustic monitoring for classification and segmentation. In real-time detection of elephant calls, network bandwidth quickly becomes a bottleneck and efficient ways to compress the data are needed. Most audio compression schemes are aimed at human listeners and are unsuitable for low-frequency elephant calls. To remedy this, we provide a novel end-to-end differentiable method for compression of audio signals that can be adapted to acoustic monitoring of any species and dramatically improves over naive coding strategies.",AAAI
Discovering Pollution Sources and Propagation Patterns in Urban Area,2017,"Air quality is one of the most important environmental concerns in the world, and it has deteriorated substantially over the past years in many countries. For example, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences reports that the problem of haze and fog in China is hitting a record level, and China is currently suffering from the worst air pollution. Among the various causal factors of air quality, particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less (i.e., PM2.5) is a very important factor; governments and people are increasingly concerned with the concentration of PM2.5. In many cities, stations for monitoring PM2.5 concentration have been built by governments or companies to monitor urban air quality. Apart from monitoring, there is a rising demand for finding pollution sources of PM2.5 and discovering the transmission of PM2.5 based on the data from PM$_{2.5}$ monitoring stations.
 However, to the best of our knowledge, none of previous work proposes a solution to the problem of detecting pollution sources and mining pollution propagation patterns from such monitoring data. In this work, we propose the first solution for the problem, which comprises two steps. The first step is to extract the uptrend intervals and calculate the causal strengths among spatially distributed sensors; The second step is to construct causality graphs and perform frequent subgraphs mining on these causality graphs to find pollution sources and propagation patterns. We use real-life monitoring data collected by a company in our experiments. Our experimental results demonstrate significant findings regarding pollution sources and pollutant propagations in Beijing, which will be useful for governments to make policy and govern pollution sources.",KDD
An integrated framework for optimizing automatic monitoring systems in large IT infrastructures,2013,"The competitive business climate and the complexity of IT environments dictate efficient and cost-effective service delivery and support of IT services. These are largely achieved by automating routine maintenance procedures, including problem detection, determination and resolution. System monitoring provides an effective and reliable means for problem detection. Coupled with automated ticket creation, it ensures that a degradation of the vital signs, defined by acceptable thresholds or monitoring conditions, is flagged as a problem candidate and sent to supporting personnel as an incident ticket. This paper describes an integrated framework for minimizing false positive tickets and maximizing the monitoring coverage for system faults.
 In particular, the integrated framework defines monitoring conditions and the optimal corresponding delay times based on an off-line analysis of historical alerts and incident tickets. Potential monitoring conditions are built on a set of predictive rules which are automatically generated by a rule-based learning algorithm with coverage, confidence and rule complexity criteria. These conditions and delay times are propagated as configurations into run-time monitoring systems. Moreover, a part of misconfigured monitoring conditions can be corrected according to false negative tickets that are discovered by another text classification algorithm in this framework. This paper also provides implementation details of a program product that uses this framework and shows some illustrative examples of successful results.",KDD
Urban Water Quality Prediction based on Multi-task Multi-view Learning,2016,"Urban water quality is of great importance to our daily lives. Prediction of urban water quality help control water pollution and protect human health. In this work, we forecast the water quality of a station over the next few hours, using a multi-task multi-view learning method to fuse multiple datasets from different domains. In particular, our learning model comprises two alignments. The first alignment is the spaio-temporal view alignment, which combines local spatial and temporal information of each station. The second alignment is the prediction alignment among stations, which captures their spatial correlations and performs co-predictions by incorporating these correlations. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",IJCAI
Large Landscape Conservation &mdash; Synthetic and Real-World Datasets,2013,"Biodiversity underpins ecosystem goods and services and hence protecting it is key to achieving sustainability. However, the persistence of many species is threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation due to human land use and climate change. Conservation efforts are implemented under very limited economic resources, and therefore designing scalable, cost-efficient and systematic approaches for conservation planning is an important and challenging computational task. In particular, preserving landscape connectivity between good habitat has become a key conservation priority in recent years. We give an overview of landscape connectivity conservation and some of the underlying graph-theoretic optimization problems. We present a synthetic generator capable of creating families of randomized structured problems, capturing the essential features of real-world instances but allowing for a thorough typical-case performance evaluation of different solution methods. We also present two large-scale real-world datasets, including economic data on land cost, and species data for grizzly bears, wolverines and lynx.",AAAI
Dynamic Resource Allocation in Conservation Planning,2011,"Consider the problem of protecting endangered species by selecting patches of land to be used for conservation purposes. Typically, the availability of patches changes over time, and recommendations must be made dynamically. This is a challenging prototypical example of a sequential optimization problem under uncertainty in computational sustainability. Existing techniques do not scale to problems of realistic size. In this paper, we develop an efficient algorithm for adaptively making recommendations for dynamic conservation planning, and prove that it obtains near-optimal performance. We further evaluate our approach on a detailed reserve design case study of conservation planning for three rare species in the Pacific Northwest of the United States.",AAAI
Robust Network Design For Multispecies Conservation,2013,"Our work is motivated by an important network design application in computational sustainability concerning wildlife conservation. In the face of human development and climate change, it is important that conservation plans for protecting landscape connectivity exhibit certain level of robustness. While previous work has focused on conservation strategies that result in a connected network of habitat reserves, the robustness of the proposed solutions has not been taken into account. In order to address this important aspect, we formalize the problem as a node-weighted bi-criteria network design problem with connectivity requirements on the number of disjoint paths between pairs of nodes. While in most previous work on survivable network design the objective is to minimize the cost of the selected network, our goal is to optimize the quality of the selected paths within a specified budget, while meeting the connectivity requirements. We characterize the complexity of the problem under different restrictions. We provide a mixed-integer programming encoding that allows for finding solutions with optimality guarantees, as well as a hybrid local search method with better scaling behavior but no guarantees. We evaluate the typical-case performance of our approaches using a synthetic benchmark, and apply them to a large-scale real-world network design problem concerning the conservation of wolverine and lynx populations in the U.S. Rocky Mountains (Montana).",AAAI
Water Conservation Through Facilitation on Residential Landscapes,2011,"Plants can have positive effects on each other in numerous ways, including protection from harsh environmental conditions. This phenomenon, known as facilitation, occurs in water-stressed environments when shade from larger shrubs protects smaller annuals from harsh sun, enabling them to exist on scarce water. The topic of this paper is a model of this phenomenon that allows search algorithms to find residential landscape designs that incorporate facilitation to conserve water. This model is based in botany; it captures the growth requirements of real plant species in a fitness function, but also includes a penalty term in that function that encourages facilitative interactions with other plants on the landscape. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, two search strategies--simulated annealing and agent-based search--were applied to models of different collections of simulated plant types and landscapes with different light distributions. These two search strategies produced landscape designs with different spatial distributions of the larger plants. All designs exhibited facilitation and lower water use than designs where facilitation was not included.",AAAI
Intelligent Habitat Restoration Under Uncertainty,2016,"Conservation is an ethic of sustainable use of natural resources which focuses on the preservation of biodiversity, i.e., the degree of variation of life. Conservation planning seeks to reach this goal by means of deliberate actions, aimed at the protection (or restoration) of biodiversity features. In this paper we present an intelligent system to assist conservation managers in planning habitat restoration actions, with focus on the activities to be carried out in the islands of the Great Barrier Reef (QLD) and the Pilbara (WA) regions of Australia. In particular, we propose a constrained optimisation formulation of the habitat restoration planning (HRP) problem, capturing aspects such as population dynamics and uncertainty. We show that the HRP is NP-hard, and develop a constraint programming (CP) model and a large neighbourhood search (LNS) procedure to generate activity plans under budgeting constraints.",AAAI
Hierarchical Electricity Time Series Forecasting for Integrating Consumption Patterns Analysis and Aggregation Consistency,2018,"Electricity demand forecasting is a very important problem for energy supply and environmental protection. It can be formalized as a hierarchical time series forecasting problem with the aggregation constraints according to the geographical hierarchy, since the sum of the prediction results of the disaggregated time series should be equal to the prediction results of the aggregated ones. However in most previous work, the aggregation consistency is ensured at the loss of forecast accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering-based hierarchical electricity time series forecasting approach. Instead of dealing with the geographical hierarchy directly, we explore electricity consumption patterns by clustering analysis and build a new consumption pattern based time series hierarchy. We then present a novel hierarchical forecasting method with consumption hierarchical aggregation constraints to improve the electricity demand predictions of the bottom level, followed by a ``bottom-up"" method to obtain forecasts of the geographical higher levels. Especially, we observe that in our consumption pattern based hierarchy the reconciliation error of the bottom level time series is ``correlated"" to its membership degree of the corresponding cluster (consumption pattern), and hence apply this correlations as the regularization term in our forecasting objective function. Extensive experiments on real-life datasets verify that our approach achieves the best prediction accuracy, compared with the state-of-the-artmethods.",IJCAI
Dynamic Optimization of Landscape Connectivity Embedding Spatial-Capture-Recapture Information,2017,"Maintaining landscape connectivity is increasingly important in wildlife conservation, especially for species experiencing the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation. We propose a novel approach to dynamically optimize landscape connectivity. Our approach is based on a mixed integer program formulation, embedding a spatial capture-recapture model that estimates the density, space usage, and landscape connectivity for a given species. Our method takes into account the fact that local animal density and connectivity change dynamically and non-linearly with different habitat protection plans. In order to scale up our encoding, we propose a sampling scheme via random partitioning of the search space using parity functions. We show that our method scales to real-world size problems and dramatically outperforms the solution quality of an expectation maximization approach and a sample average approximation approach.",AAAI
Automated Volumetric Intravascular Plaque Classification Using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT),2016,"An estimated 17.5 million people died from a cardiovascular disease in 2012, representing 31% of all global deaths. Most acute coronary events result from rupture of the protective fibrous cap overlying an atherosclerotic plaque. The task of early identification of plaque types that can potentially rupture is, therefore, of great importance. The state-of-the-art approach to imaging blood vessels is intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT). However, currently, this is an offline approach where the images are first collected and then manually analyzed a frame at a time to identify regions at risk of thrombosis. This process is extremely laborious, time consuming and prone to human error. We are building a system that, when complete, will provide interactive 3D visualization of a blood vessel as an IVOCT is in progress. The visualization will highlight different plaque types and enable quick identification of regions at risk for thrombosis. In this paper, we describe our approach, focusing on machine learning methods that are a key enabling technology. Our empirical results using real OCT data show that our approach can identify different plaque types efficiently with high accuracy across multiple patients.",AAAI
Hospital Stockpiling Problems with Inventory Sharing,2016,"Hospitals are typically optimized to operate near capacity, and there are serious concerns that our healthcare system is not prepared for the next pandemic. Stockpiles of different supplies, e.g., personal protective equipments (PPE) and medical equipment, need to be maintained in order to be able to respond to any future pandemics. Large outbreaks occur with a low probability, and such stockpiles require big investments. Further, hospitals often have mutual sharing agreements, which makes the problem of stockpiling decisions a natural game-theoretical problem. In this paper, we formalize hospital stockpiling as a game-theoretical problem. We use the notion of pairwise Nash stability as a solution concept for this problem, and characterize its structure. We show that stable strategies can lead to high unsatisfied demands in some scenarios, and stockpiles might not be maintained at all nodes. We also show that stable strategies and the social optimum can be computed efficiently.",AAAI
Robust Cuts Over Time: Combatting the Spread of Invasive Species with Unreliable Biological Control,2012,"Widespread accounts of the harmful effects of invasive species have stimulated both practical and theoretical studies on how the spread of these destructive agents can be contained. In practice, a widely used method is the deployment of biological control agents, that is, the release of an additional species (which may also spread) that creates a hostile environment for the invader. Seeding colonies of these protective biological control agents can be used to build a kind of living barrier against the spread of the harmful invader, but the ecological literature documents that attempts to establish colonies of biological control agents often fail (opening gaps in the barrier). Further, the supply of the protective species is limited, and the full supply may not be available immediately. This problem has a natural temporal component: biological control is deployed as the extent of the harmful invasion grows. How can a limited supply of unreliable biological control agents best be deployed over time to protect the landscape against the spread of a harmful invasive species? To explore this question we introduce a new family of stochastic graph vaccination problems that generalizes ideas from social networks and multistage graph vaccination. We point out a deterministic (1 - 1/e)-approximation algorithm for a deterministic base case studied in the social networks literature (matching the previous best randomized (1 -1/e) guarantee for that problem). Next, we show that the randomized (1 -1/e) guarantee (and a deterministic 1/2 guarantee) can be extended to our much more general family of stochastic graph vaccination problems in which vaccinations (a.k.a. biological control colonies) spread but may be unreliable. For the non-spreading vaccination case with unreliable vaccines, we give matching results in trees. Qualitatively, our extension is from computing Ã¢â¬Åcuts over timeÃ¢â¬Â to computing Ã¢â¬Årobust cuts over time.Ã¢â¬Â Our new family of problems captures the key tensions we identify for containing invasive species spread with unreliable biological control agents: a robust barrier is built over time with unreliable resources to contain an expanding invasion.",AAAI
Gated Residual Recurrent Graph Neural Networks for Traffic Prediction,2019,"Traffic prediction is of great importance to traffic management and public safety, and very challenging as it is affected by many complex factors, such as spatial dependency of complicated road networks and temporal dynamics, and many more. The factors make traffic prediction a challenging task due to the uncertainty and complexity of traffic states. In the literature, many research works have applied deep learning methods on traffic prediction problems combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which CNNs are utilized for spatial dependency and RNNs for temporal dynamics. However, such combinations cannot capture the connectivity and globality of traffic networks. In this paper, we first propose to adopt residual recurrent graph neural networks (Res-RGNN) that can capture graph-based spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics jointly. Due to gradient vanishing, RNNs are hard to capture periodic temporal correlations. Hence, we further propose a novel hop scheme into Res-RGNN to utilize the periodic temporal dependencies. Based on Res-RGNN and hop Res-RGNN, we finally propose a novel end-to-end multiple Res-RGNNs framework, referred to as Ã¢â¬ÅMRes-RGNNÃ¢â¬Â, for traffic prediction. Experimental results on two traffic datasets have demonstrated that the proposed MRes-RGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly.",AAAI
Predicting Estimated Time of Arrival for Commercial Flights,2018,"Unprecedented growth is expected globally in commercial air traffic over the next ten years. To accommodate this increase in volume, a new concept of operations has been implemented in the context of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) in the USA and the Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) in Europe. However, both of the systems approach airspace capacity and efficiency deterministically, failing to account for external operational circumstances which can directly affect the aircraft's actual flight profile. A major factor in increased airspace efficiency and capacity is accurate prediction of Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) for commercial flights, which can be a challenging task due to a non-deterministic nature of environmental factors, and air traffic. Inaccurate prediction of ETA can cause potential safety risks and loss of resources for Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSP), airlines and passengers. In this paper, we present a novel ETA Prediction System for commercial flights. The system learns from historical trajectories and uses their pertinent 3D grid points to collect key features such as weather parameters, air traffic, and airport data along the potential flight path. The features are fed into various regression models and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and the best performing models with the most accurate ETA predictions are compared with the ETAs currently operational by the European ANSP, EUROCONTROL. Evaluations on an extensive set of real trajectory, weather, and airport data in Europe verify that our prediction system generates more accurate ETAs with a far smaller standard deviation than those of EUROCONTROL. This translates to smaller prediction windows of flight arrival times, thereby enabling airlines to make more cost-effective ground resource allocation and ANSPs to make more efficient flight schedules.",KDD
Urban Traffic Prediction from Spatio-Temporal Data Using Deep Meta Learning,2019,"Predicting urban traffic is of great importance to intelligent transportation systems and public safety, yet is very challenging because of two aspects: 1) complex spatio-temporal correlations of urban traffic, including spatial correlations between locations along with temporal correlations among timestamps; 2) diversity of such spatio-temporal correlations, which vary from location to location and depend on the surrounding geographical information, e.g., points of interests and road networks. To tackle these challenges, we proposed a deep-meta-learning based model, entitled ST-MetaNet, to collectively predict traffic in all location at once. ST-MetaNet employs a sequence-to-sequence architecture, consisting of an encoder to learn historical information and a decoder to make predictions step by step. In specific, the encoder and decoder have the same network structure, consisting of a recurrent neural network to encode the traffic, a meta graph attention network to capture diverse spatial correlations, and a meta recurrent neural network to consider diverse temporal correlations. Extensive experiments were conducted based on two real-world datasets to illustrate the effectiveness of ST-MetaNet beyond several state-of-the-art methods.",KDD
Engineering Works Scheduling for Hong Kong&rsquo;s Rail Network,2014,"This paper describes how AI is used to plan, schedule, and optimize nightly engineering works for both the commuter and rapid transit lines in Hong Kong. The MTR Corporation Limited operates and manages all the rail lines in Hong Kong. Its Ã¢â¬ÅEngineering Works and Traffic Information Management SystemÃ¢â¬Â (ETMS) is a mission critical system that manages all information related to engineering works and their related track possessions and engineering train movements. The AI Engine described in this paper is a component of this ETMS. In Hong Kong, the maintenance, inspection, repair, or installation works along the rail lines are done during the very short non-traffic hours (NTH) of roughly 4 to 5 hours each night. These engineering works can be along the running tracks, track-side, tunnel, freight yards, sub-depots, depot maintenance tracks, etc. The proper scheduling of necessary engineering works is crucial to maintaining a reliable and safe train service during normal hours. The AI Engine optimizes resource allocation to maximize the number of engineering works that can be performed, while ensuring all safety, environment, and operational rules and constraints are met. The work described is part of a project to redesign and replace the existing ETMS, deployed in 2004, with an updated technology platform and modern IT architecture, to provide a more robust and scalable system that potentially can be deployed to other cities around the world.",AAAI
Planning Bike Lanes based on Sharing-Bikes' Trajectories,2017,"Cycling as a green transportation mode has been promoted by many governments all over the world. As a result, constructing effective bike lanes has become a crucial task for governments promoting the cycling life style, as well-planned bike paths can reduce traffic congestion and decrease safety risks for both cyclists and motor vehicle drivers. Unfortunately, existing trajectory mining approaches for bike lane planning do not consider key realistic government constraints: 1) budget limitations, 2) construction convenience, and 3) bike lane utilization.
 In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach to develop bike lane construction plans based on large-scale real world bike trajectory data. We enforce these constraints to formulate our problem and introduce a flexible objective function to tune the benefit between coverage of the number of users and the length of their trajectories. We prove the NP-hardness of the problem and propose greedy-based heuristics to address it. Finally, we deploy our system on Microsoft Azure, providing extensive experiments and case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",KDD
Sample-Targeted Clinical Trial Adaptation,2015,Clinical trial adaptation refers to any adjustment of the trial protocol after the onset of the trial. The main goal is to make the process of introducing new medical interventions to patients more efficient by reducing the cost and the time associated with evaluating their safety and efficacy. The principal question is how should adaptation be performed so as to minimize the chance of distorting the outcome of the trial. We propose a novel method for achieving this. Unlike previous work our approach focuses on trial adaptation by sample size adjustment. We adopt a recently proposed stratification framework based on collected auxiliary data and show that this information together with the primary measured variables can be used to make a probabilistically informed choice of the particular sub-group a sample should be removed from. Experiments on simulated data are used to illustrate the effectiveness of our method and its application in practice.,AAAI
GAMENet: Graph Augmented MEmory Networks for Recommending Medication Combination,2019,"Recent progress in deep learning is revolutionizing the healthcare domain including providing solutions to medication recommendations, especially recommending medication combination for patients with complex health conditions. Existing approaches either do not customize based on patient health history, or ignore existing knowledge on drug-drug interactions (DDI) that might lead to adverse outcomes. To fill this gap, we propose the Graph Augmented Memory Networks (GAMENet), which integrates the drug-drug interactions knowledge graph by a memory module implemented as a graph convolutional networks, and models longitudinal patient records as the query. It is trained end-to-end to provide safe and personalized recommendation of medication combination. We demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of GAMENet by comparing with several state-of-the-art methods on real EHR data. GAMENet outperformed all baselines in all effectiveness measures, and also achieved 3.60% DDI rate reduction from existing EHR data.",AAAI
Safe Contextual Bayesian Optimization for Sustainable Room Temperature PID Control Tuning,2019,"We tune one of the most common heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) control loops, namely the temperature control of a room. For economical and environmental reasons, it is of prime importance to optimize the performance of this system. Buildings account from 20 to 40 % of a country energy consumption, and almost 50 % of it comes from HVAC systems. Scenario projections predict a 30 % decrease in heating consumption by 2050 due to efficiency increase. Advanced control techniques can improve performance; however, the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control is typically used due to its simplicity and overall performance. We use Safe Contextual Bayesian Optimization to optimize the PID parameters without human intervention. We reduce costs by 32 % compared to the current PID controller setting while assuring safety and comfort to people in the room. The results of this work have an immediate impact on the room control loop performances and its related commissioning costs. Furthermore, this successful attempt paves the way for further use at different levels of HVAC systems, with promising energy, operational, and commissioning costs savings, and it is a practical demonstration of the positive effects that Artificial Intelligence can have on environmental sustainability.",IJCAI
Risk-Aware Planning: Methods and Case Study for Safer Driving Routes,2017,"Vehicle crashes account for over one million fatalities and many more million injuries annually worldwide. Some roads are safer than others, so a driving route optimized for safety may reduce the number of crashes. We have developed a method to estimate the probability of a crash on any road as a function of the traffic volume, road characteristics, and environmental conditions. We trained a regression model to estimate traffic volume and a binary classifier to estimate crash probability on road segments. Modeling a routeÃ¢â¬â¢s crash probability as a series of Bernoulli probability trials, we show how to use a simple Dijkstra algorithm to compute the safest route between two locations. Compared to the fastest route, the safest route averages about 1.7 times as long in duration and about half as dangerous. We also show how to smoothly trade off safety for time, giving several different route options with different crash probabilities and durations.",AAAI
Decision Making for Improving Maritime Traffic Safety Using Constraint Programming,2019,"Maritime navigational safety is of utmost importance to prevent vessel collisions in heavily trafficked ports, and avoid environmental costs. In case of a likely near miss among vessels, port traffic controllers provide assistance for safely navigating the waters, often at very short lead times. A better strategy is to avoid such situations from even happening. To achieve this, we a) formalize the decision model for traffic hotspot mitigation including realistic maritime navigational features and constraints through consultations with domain experts; and b) develop a constraint programming based scheduling approach to mitigate hotspots. We model the problem as a variant of the resource constrained project scheduling problem to adjust vessel movement schedules such that the average delay is minimized and navigational safety constraints are also satisfied. We conduct a thorough evaluation on key performance indicators using real world data, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating high-risk situations.",IJCAI
Explaining Aviation Safety Incidents Using Deep Temporal Multiple Instance Learning,2018,"Although aviation accidents are rare, safety incidents occur more frequently and require a careful analysis to detect and mitigate risks in a timely manner. Analyzing safety incidents using operational data and producing event-based explanations is invaluable to airline companies as well as to governing organizations such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States. However, this task is challenging because of the complexity involved in mining multi-dimensional heterogeneous time series data, the lack of time-step-wise annotation of events in a flight, and the lack of scalable tools to perform analysis over a large number of events. In this work, we propose a precursor mining algorithm that identifies events in the multidimensional time series that are correlated with the safety incident. Precursors are valuable to systems health and safety monitoring and in explaining and forecasting safety incidents. Current methods suffer from poor scalability to high dimensional time series data and are inefficient in capturing temporal behavior. We propose an approach by combining multiple-instance learning (MIL) and deep recurrent neural networks (DRNN) to take advantage of MIL's ability to learn using weakly supervised data and DRNN's ability to model temporal behavior. We describe the algorithm, the data, the intuition behind taking a MIL approach, and a comparative analysis of the proposed algorithm with baseline models. We also discuss the application to a real-world aviation safety problem using data from a commercial airline company and discuss the model's abilities and shortcomings, with some final remarks about possible deployment directions.",KDD
Transforming Underwriting in the Life Insurance Industry,2019,"Life insurance provides trillions of dollars of financial security for hundreds of millions of individuals and families worldwide. Life insurance companies must accurately assess individual-level mortality risk to simultaneously maintain financial strength and price their products competitively. The traditional underwriting process used to assess this risk is based on manually examining an applicantÃ¢â¬â¢s health, behavioral, and financial profile. The existence of large historical data sets provides an unprecedented opportunity for artificial intelligence and machine learning to transform underwriting in the life insurance industry. We present an overview of how a rich application data set and survival modeling were combined to develop a life score that has been deployed in an algorithmic underwriting system at MassMutual, an American mutual life insurance company serving millions of clients. Through a novel evaluation framework, we show that the life score outperforms traditional underwriting by 6% on the basis of claims. We describe how engagement with actuaries, medical doctors, underwriters, and reinsurers was paramount to building an algorithmic underwriting system with a predictive model at its core. Finally, we provide details of the deployed system and highlight its value, which includes saving millions of dollars in operational efficiency while driving the decisions behind tens of billions of dollars of benefits.",AAAI
SurfCon: Synonym Discovery on Privacy-Aware Clinical Data,2019,"Unstructured clinical texts contain rich health-related information. To better utilize the knowledge buried in clinical texts, discovering synonyms for a medical query term has become an important task. Recent automatic synonym discovery methods leveraging raw text information have been developed. However, to preserve patient privacy and security, it is usually quite difficult to get access to large-scale raw clinical texts. In this paper, we study a new setting named synonym discovery on privacy-aware clinical data (i.e., medical terms extracted from the clinical texts and their aggregated co-occurrence counts, without raw clinical texts). To solve the problem, we propose a new framework SurfCon that leverages two important types of information in the privacy-aware clinical data, i.e., the surface form information, and the global context information for synonym discovery. In particular, the surface form module enables us to detect synonyms that look similar while the global context module plays a complementary role to discover synonyms that are semantically similar but in different surface forms, and both allow us to deal with the OOV query issue (i.e., when the query is not found in the given data). We conduct extensive experiments and case studies on publicly available privacy-aware clinical data, and show that SurfCon can outperform strong baseline methods by large margins under various settings.",KDD
Online Adaptive Asymmetric Active Learning for Budgeted Imbalanced Data,2018,"This paper investigates Online Active Learning (OAL) for imbalanced unlabeled datastream, where only a budget of labels can be queried to optimize some cost-sensitive performance measure. OAL can solve many real-world problems, such as anomaly detection in healthcare, finance and network security. In these problems, there are two key challenges: the query budget is often limited; the ratio between two classes is highly imbalanced. To address these challenges, existing work of OAL adopts either asymmetric losses or queries (an isolated asymmetric strategy) to tackle the imbalance, and uses first-order methods to optimize the cost-sensitive measure. However, they may incur two deficiencies: (1) the poor ability in handling imbalanced data due to the isolated asymmetric strategy; (2) relative slow convergence rate due to the first-order optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel Online Adaptive Asymmetric Active (OA3) learning algorithm, which is based on a new asymmetric strategy (merging both the asymmetric losses and queries strategies), and second-order optimization. We theoretically analyze its bounds, and also empirically evaluate it on four real-world online anomaly detection tasks. Promising results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm in various application domains.",KDD
Forecasting Intra-Hour Imbalances in Electric Power Systems,2019,"Keeping the electricity production in balance with the actual demand is becoming a difficult and expensive task in spite of an involvement of experienced human operators. This is due to the increasing complexity of the electric power grid system with the intermittent renewable production as one of the contributors. A beforehand information about an occurring imbalance can help the transmission system operator to adjust the production plans, and thus ensure a high security of supply by reducing the use of costly balancing reserves, and consequently reduce undesirable fluctuations of the 50 Hz power system frequency. In this paper, we introduce the relatively new problem of an intra-hour imbalance forecasting for the transmission system operator (TSO). We focus on the use case of the Norwegian TSO, Statnett. We present a complementary imbalance forecasting tool that is able to support the TSO in determining the trend of future imbalances, and show the potential to proactively alleviate imbalances with a higher accuracy compared to the contemporary solution.",AAAI
An Antimicrobial Prescription Surveillance System that Learns from Experience,2013,"Inappropriate prescribing of antimicrobials is a major clinical and health concern, as well as a financial burden, in hospitals worldwide. In this paper, we describe a deployed automated antimicrobial prescription surveillance system that has been assisting hospital pharmacists in identifying and reporting inappropriate antimicrobial prescriptions. One of the key characteristics of this system is its ability to learn new rules for detecting inappropriate prescriptions based on previous false alerts. The supervised learning algorithm combines instance-based learning and rule induction techniques. It exploits temporal abstraction to extract a meaningful time interval representation from raw clinical data, and applies nearest neighbor classification with a distance function on both temporal and non-temporal parameters. The learning capability is valuable both in configuring the system for initial deployment and improving its long term use. We give an overview of the application, point to lessons learned so far and provide insight into the machine learning capability.",AAAI
IntelliLight: A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Intelligent Traffic Light Control,2018,"The intelligent traffic light control is critical for an efficient transportation system. While existing traffic lights are mostly operated by hand-crafted rules, an intelligent traffic light control system should be dynamically adjusted to real-time traffic. There is an emerging trend of using deep reinforcement learning technique for traffic light control and recent studies have shown promising results. However, existing studies have not yet tested the methods on the real-world traffic data and they only focus on studying the rewards without interpreting the policies. In this paper, we propose a more effective deep reinforcement learning model for traffic light control. We test our method on a large-scale real traffic dataset obtained from surveillance cameras. We also show some interesting case studies of policies learned from the real data.",KDD
Group Sparse Bayesian Learning for Active Surveillance on Epidemic Dynamics,2018,"Predicting epidemic dynamics is of great value in understanding and controlling diffusion processes, such as infectious disease spread and information propagation. This task is intractable, especially when surveillance resources are very limited. To address the challenge, we study the problem of active surveillance, i.e., how to identify a small portion of system components as sentinels to effect monitoring, such that the epidemic dynamics of an entire system can be readily predicted from the partial data collected by such sentinels. We propose a novel measure, the gamma value, to identify the sentinels by modeling a sentinel network with row sparsity structure. We design a flexible group sparse Bayesian learning algorithm to mine the sentinel network suitable for handling both linear and non-linear dynamical systems by using the expectation maximization method and variational approximation. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is theoretically analyzed and empirically validated using both synthetic and real-world data.",AAAI
Reconstructing The Mers Disease Outbreak From News,2019,"Disease surveillance is critical for mobilizing health care resources and deciding on isolation measures to contain the spread of infectious diseases. Because ground truth signals of rare and deadly diseases are sparse, it can be useful to enrich surveillance systems using measures of social and environmental factors which are known to influence the spread of a disease. One approach to measure such factors is by using real time news streams. In this study, we model the epidemiological transmission of the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) disease during the outbreak that occurred from 2013 to 2018 in the Arabian peninsula. Using the GDELT news event database, we show that conflict related signals allow us to reconstruct the time series of newly infected cases per week. This reduces the residual sum of squared errors by a factor of 3.36 as compared to a standard epidemiological model. We also capture interpretable time-sensitive factors which illustrate the importance of using real time news stream to model the evolution of a disease such as MERS and facilitate early and effective policy interventions.",COMPASS
Dynamic Poisson Autoregression for Influenza-Like-Illness Case Count Prediction,2015,"Influenza-like-illness (ILI) is among of the most common diseases worldwide, and reliable forecasting of the same can have significant public health benefits. Recently, new forms of disease surveillance based upon digital data sources have been proposed and are continuing to attract attention over traditional surveillance methods. In this paper, we focus on short-term ILI case count prediction and develop a dynamic Poisson autoregressive model with exogenous inputs variables (DPARX) for flu forecasting. In this model, we allow the autoregressive model to change over time. In order to control the variation in the model, we construct a model similarity graph to specify the relationship between pairs of models at two time points and embed prior knowledge in terms of the structure of the graph. We formulate ILI case count forecasting as a convex optimization problem, whose objective balances the autoregressive loss and the model similarity regularization induced by the structure of the similarity graph. We then propose an efficient algorithm to solve this problem by block coordinate descent. We apply our model and the corresponding learning method on historical ILI records for 15 countries around the world using a variety of syndromic surveillance data sources. Our approach provides consistently better forecasting results than state-of-the-art models available for short-term ILI case count forecasting.",KDD
Modeling and Mining Spatiotemporal Patterns of Infection Risk from Heterogeneous Data for Active Surveillance Planning,2014,"Active surveillance is a desirable way to prevent the spread of infectious diseases in that it aims to timely discover individual incidences through an active searching for patients. However, in practice active surveillance is difficult to implement especially when monitoring space is large but available resources are limited. Therefore, it is extremely important for public health authorities to know how to distribute their very sparse resources to high-priority regions so as to maximize the outcomes of active surveillance. In this paper, we raise the problem of active surveillance planning and provide an effective method to address it via modeling and mining spatiotemporal patterns of infection risks from heterogeneous data sources. Taking malaria as an example, we perform an empirical study on real-world data to validate our method and provide our new findings.",AAAI
Towards Station-Level Demand Prediction for Effective Rebalancing in Bike-Sharing Systems,2018,"Bike sharing systems continue gaining worldwide popularity as they offer benefits on various levels, from society to environment. Given that those systems tend to be unbalanced along time, bikes are typically redistributed throughout the day to better meet the demand. Reasonably accurate demand prediction is key to effective redistribution; however, it is has received only little attention in the literature. In this paper, we focus on predicting the hourly demand for demand rentals and returns at each station of the system. The proposed model uses temporal and weather features to predict demand mean and variance. It first extracts the main traffic behaviors from the stations. These simplified behaviors are then predicted and used to perform station-level predictions based on machine learning and statistical inference techniques. We then focus on determining decision intervals, which are often used by bike sharing companies for their online rebalancing operations. Our models are validated on a two-year period of real data from BIXI MontrÃÂ©al. A worst-case analysis suggests that the intervals generated by our models may decrease unsatisfied demands by 30% when compared to the current methodology employed in practice.",KDD
Incentivizing Users for Balancing Bike Sharing Systems,2015,"Bike sharing systems have been recently adopted by a growing number of cities as a new means of transportation offering citizens a flexible, fast and green alternative for mobility. Users can pick up or drop off the bicycles at a station of their choice without prior notice or time planning. This increased flexibility comes with the challenge of unpredictable and fluctuating demand as well as irregular flow patterns of the bikes. As a result, these systems can incur imbalance problems such as the unavailability of bikes or parking docks at stations. In this light, operators deploy fleets of vehicles which re-distribute the bikes in order to guarantee a desirable service level. Can we engage the users themselves to solve the imbalance problem in bike sharing systems? In this paper, we address this question and present a crowdsourcing mechanism that incentivizes the users in the bike repositioning process by providing them with alternate choices to pick or return bikes in exchange for monetary incentives. We design the complete architecture of the incentives system which employs optimal pricing policies using the approach of regret minimization in online learning. We investigate the incentive compatibility of our mechanism and extensively evaluate it through simulations based on data collected via a survey study. Finally, we deployed the proposed system through a smartphone app among users of a large scale bike sharing system operated by a public transport company, and we provide results from this experimental deployment. To our knowledge, this is the first dynamic incentives system for bikes re-distribution ever deployed in a real-world bike sharing system.",AAAI
A Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Rebalancing Dockless Bike Sharing Systems,2019,"Bike sharing provides an environment-friendly way for traveling and is booming all over the world. Yet, due to the high similarity of user travel patterns, the bike imbalance problem constantly occurs, especially for dockless bike sharing systems, causing significant impact on service quality and company revenue. Thus, it has become a critical task for bike sharing operators to resolve such imbalance efficiently. In this paper, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning framework for incentivizing users to rebalance such systems. We model the problem as a Markov decision process and take both spatial and temporal features into consideration. We develop a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm called Hierarchical Reinforcement Pricing (HRP), which builds upon the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm. Different from existing methods that often ignore spatial information and rely heavily on accurate prediction, HRP captures both spatial and temporal dependencies using a divide-and-conquer structure with an embedded localized module. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate HRP, based on a dataset from Mobike, a major Chinese dockless bike sharing company. Results show that HRP performs close to the 24-timeslot look-ahead optimization, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both service level and bike distribution. It also transfers well when applied to unseen areas.",AAAI
Bike Angels: An Analysis of Citi Bike's Incentive Program,2018,"We develop models to help at each stage: to accept or reject incoming requests, distinguish between technical support questions to a help desk and substantive requests to the SAC, and send substantive requests to the appropriate federal agency. Given the office's needs, our system can automatically accept or reject 85% of all requests, automatically send 39% of requests to a technical helpdesk or to the SAC, and automatically routes 49% of all requests to the most appropriate federal agency. These models each operate at a different step in the manual request sorting process. Incorporation of our models into the request system would save the office of the president 3.8 man hours per day accepting and rejecting requests, 3.1 man hours per day deciding whether requests should go to the helpdesk, and 4.8 man hours per day routing requests to federal agencies. Together, this would allow the government to process 24.4% more petitions, allowing them to better address citizen needs with limited resources.",COMPASS
Rebalancing Bike Sharing Systems: A Multi-source Data Smart Optimization,2016,"Bike sharing systems, aiming at providing the missing links in public transportation systems, are becoming popular in urban cities. A key to success for a bike sharing systems is the effectiveness of rebalancing operations, that is, the efforts of restoring the number of bikes in each station to its target value by routing vehicles through pick-up and drop-off operations. There are two major issues for this bike rebalancing problem: the determination of station inventory target level and the large scale multiple capacitated vehicle routing optimization with outlier stations. The key challenges include demand prediction accuracy for inventory target level determination, and an effective optimizer for vehicle routing with hundreds of stations. To this end, in this paper, we develop a Meteorology Similarity Weighted K-Nearest-Neighbor (MSWK) regressor to predict the station pick-up demand based on large-scale historic trip records. Based on further analysis on the station network constructed by station-station connections and the trip duration, we propose an inter station bike transition (ISBT) model to predict the station drop-off demand. Then, we provide a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation of multiple capacitated bike routing problem with the objective of minimizing total travel distance. To solve it, we propose an Adaptive Capacity Constrained K-centers Clustering (AdaCCKC) algorithm to separate outlier stations (the demands of these stations are very large and make the optimization infeasible) and group the rest stations into clusters within which one vehicle is scheduled to redistribute bikes between stations. In this way, the large scale multiple vehicle routing problem is reduced to inner cluster one vehicle routing problem with guaranteed feasible solutions. Finally, the extensive experimental results on the NYC Citi Bike system show the advantages of our approach for bike demand prediction and large-scale bike rebalancing optimization.",KDD
Improving Customer Satisfaction in Bike Sharing Systems through Dynamic Repositioning,2019,"""In bike sharing systems (BSSs), the uncoordinated movements of customers using bikes lead to empty or congested stations, which causes a significant loss in customer demand. In order to reduce the lost demand, a wide variety of existing research has employed a fixed set of historical demand patterns to design efficient bike repositioning solutions. However, the progress remains slow in understanding the underlying uncertainties in demand and designing proactive robust bike repositioning solutions. To bridge this gap, we propose a dynamic bike repositioning approach based on a probabilistic satisficing method which uses the uncertain demand parameters that are learnt from historical data. We develop a novel and computationally efficient mixed integer linear program for maximizing the probability of satisfying the uncertain demand so as to improve the overall customer satisfaction and efficiency of the system. Extensive experimental results from a simulation model built on a real-world bike sharing data set demonstrate that our approach is not only robust to uncertainties in customer demand, but also outperforms the existing state-of-the-art repositioning approaches in terms of reducing the expected lost demand.""",IJCAI
Dynamic Bike Reposition: A Spatio-Temporal Reinforcement Learning Approach,2018,"Bike-sharing systems are widely deployed in many major cities, while the jammed and empty stations in them lead to severe customer loss. Currently, operators try to constantly reposition bikes among stations when the system is operating. However, how to efficiently reposition to minimize the customer loss in a long period remains unsolved. We propose a spatio-temporal reinforcement learning based bike reposition model to deal with this problem. Firstly, an inter-independent inner-balance clustering algorithm is proposed to cluster stations into groups. Clusters obtained have two properties, i.e. each cluster is inner-balanced and independent from the others. As there are many trikes repositioning in a very large system simultaneously, clustering is necessary to reduce the problem complexity. Secondly, we allocate multiple trikes to each cluster to conduct inner-cluster bike reposition. A spatio-temporal reinforcement learning model is designed for each cluster to learn a reposition policy in it, targeting at minimizing its customer loss in a long period. To learn each model, we design a deep neural network to estimate its optimal long-term value function, from which the optimal policy can be easily inferred. Besides formulating the model in a multi-agent way, we further reduce its training complexity by two spatio-temporal pruning rules. Thirdly, we design a system simulator based on two predictors to train and evaluate the reposition model. Experiments on real-world datasets from Citi Bike are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of our model.",KDD
Lifelong Multi-Agent Path Finding for Online Pickup and Delivery Tasks (Page 837),2017,"The multi-agent path-finding (MAPF) problem has recently received a lot of attention. However, it does not capture important characteristics of many real-world domains, such as automated warehouses, where agents are constantly engaged with new tasks. In this paper, we therefore study a lifelong version of the MAPF problem, called the multi-agent pickup and delivery (MAPD) problem. In the MAPD problem, agents have to attend to a stream of delivery tasks in an online setting. One agent has to be assigned to each delivery task. This agent has to first move to a given pickup location and then to a given delivery location while avoiding collisions with other agents. We present two decoupled MAPD algorithms, Token Passing (TP) and Token Passing with Task Swaps (TPTS). Theoretically, we show that they solve all well-formed MAPD instances, a realistic subclass of MAPD instances. Experimentally, we compare them against a centralized strawman MAPD algorithm without this guarantee in a simulated warehouse system. TP can easily be extended to a fully distributed MAPD algorithm and is the best choice when real-time computation is of primary concern since it remains efficient for MAPD instances with hundreds of agents and tasks. TPTS requires limited communication among agents and balances well between TP and the centralized MAPD algorithm.",AAMAS
DeepETA: A Spatial-Temporal Sequential Neural Network Model for Estimating Time of Arrival in Package Delivery System,2019,"Over 100 million packages are delivered every day in China due to the fast development of e-commerce. Precisely estimating the time of packagesÃ¢â¬â¢ arrival (ETA) is significantly important to improving customersÃ¢â¬â¢ experience and raising the efficiency of package dispatching. Existing methods mainly focus on predicting the time from an origin to a destination. However, in package delivery problem, one trip contains multiple destinations and the delivery time of all destinations should be predicted at any time. Furthermore, the ETA is affected by many factors especially the sequence of the latest route, the regularity of the delivery pattern and the sequence of packages to be delivered, which are difficult to learn by traditional models. This paper proposed a novel spatial-temporal sequential neural network model (DeepETA) to take fully advantages of the above factors. DeepETA is an end-to-end network that mainly consists of three parts. First, the spatial encoding and the recurrent cells are proposed to capture the spatial-temporal and sequential features of the latest delivery route. Then, two attention-based layers are designed to indicate the most possible ETA from historical frequent and relative delivery routes based on the similarity of the latest route and the future destinations. Finally, a fully connected layer is utilized to jointly learn the delivery time. Experiments on real logistics dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach has outperforming results.",AAAI
Identifying tourists from public transport commuters,2014,"Tourism industry has become a key economic driver for Singapore. Understanding the behaviors of tourists is very important for the government and private sectors, e.g., restaurants, hotels and advertising companies, to improve their existing services or create new business opportunities. In this joint work with Singapore's Land Transport Authority (LTA), we innovatively apply machine learning techniques to identity the tourists among public commuters using the public transportation data provided by LTA. On successful identification, the travelling patterns of tourists are then revealed and thus allow further analyses to be carried out such as on their favorite destinations, region of stay, etc. Technically, we model the tourists identification as a classification problem, and design an iterative learning algorithm to perform inference with limited prior knowledge and labeled data. We show the superiority of our algorithm with performance evaluation and comparison with other state-of-the-art learning algorithms. Further, we build an interactive web-based system for answering queries regarding the moving patterns of the tourists, which can be used by stakeholders to gain insight into tourists' travelling behaviors in Singapore.",KDD
Large-Scale Order Dispatch in On-Demand Ride-Hailing Platforms: A Learning and Planning Approach,2018,"We present a novel order dispatch algorithm in large-scale on-demand ride-hailing platforms. While traditional order dispatch approaches usually focus on immediate customer satisfaction, the proposed algorithm is designed to provide a more efficient way to optimize resource utilization and user experience in a global and more farsighted view. In particular, we model order dispatch as a large-scale sequential decision-making problem, where the decision of assigning an order to a driver is determined by a centralized algorithm in a coordinated way. The problem is solved in a learning and planning manner: 1) based on historical data, we first summarize demand and supply patterns into a spatiotemporal quantization, each of which indicates the expected value of a driver being in a particular state; 2) a planning step is conducted in real-time, where each driver-order-pair is valued in consideration of both immediate rewards and future gains, and then dispatch is solved using a combinatorial optimizing algorithm. Through extensive offline experiments and online AB tests, the proposed approach delivers remarkable improvement on the platform's efficiency and has been successfully deployed in the production system of Didi Chuxing.",KDD
Green Driver: AI in a Microcosm,2011,"The Green Driver app is a dynamic routing application for GPS-enabled smartphones. Green Driver combines client GPS data with real-time traffic light information provided by cities to determine optimal routes in response to driver route requests. Routes are optimized with respect to travel time, with the intention of saving the driver both time and fuel, and rerouting can occur if warranted. During a routing session, client phones communicate with a centralized server that both collects GPS data and processes route requests. All relevant data are anonymized and saved to databases for analysis; statistics are calculated from the aggregate data and fed back to the routing engine to improve future routing. Analyses can also be performed to discern driver trends: where do drivers tend to go, how long do they stay, when and where does traffic congestion occur, and so on. The system uses a number of techniques from the field of artificial intelligence. We apply a variant of A* search for solving the stochastic shortest path problem in order to find optimal driving routes through a network of roads given light-status information. We also use dynamic programming and hidden Markov models to determine the progress of a driver through a network of roads from GPS data and light-status data.

Origin-Destination Matrix Prediction via Graph Convolution: a New Perspective of Passenger Demand Modeling,2019,"Ride-hailing applications are becoming more and more popular for providing drivers and passengers with convenient ride services, especially in metropolises like Beijing or New York. To obtain the passengers' mobility patterns, the online platforms of ride services need to predict the number of passenger demands from one region to another in advance. We formulate this problem as an Origin-Destination Matrix Prediction (ODMP) problem. Though this problem is essential to large-scale providers of ride services for helping them make decisions and some providers have already put it forward in public, existing studies have not solved this problem well. One of the main reasons is that the ODMP problem is more challenging than the common demand prediction. Besides the number of demands in a region, it also requires the model to predict the destinations of them. In addition, data sparsity is a severe issue. To solve the problem effectively, we propose a unified model, Grid-Embedding based Multi-task Learning (GEML) which consists of two components focusing on spatial and temporal information respectively. The Grid-Embedding part is designed to model the spatial mobility patterns of passengers and neighboring relationships of different areas, the pre-weighted aggregator of which aims to sense the sparsity and range of data. The Multi-task Learning framework focuses on modeling temporal attributes and capturing several objectives of the ODMP problem. The evaluation of our model is conducted on real operational datasets from UCAR and Didi. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our GEML against the state-of-the-art approaches.",KDD
Forecasting Collector Road Speeds Under High Percentage of Missing Data,2015,"Accurate road speed predictions can help drivers in smart route planning. Although the issue has been studied previously, most existing work focus on arterial roads only, where sensors are configured closely for collecting complete real-time data. For collector roads where sensors sparsly cover, however, speed predictions are often ignored. With GPS-equipped floating car signals being available nowadays, we aim at forecasting collector road speeds by utilizing these signals. The main challenge compared with arterial roads comes from the missing data. In a time slot of the real case, over 90% of collector roads cannot be covered by enough floating cars. Thus most traditional approaches for arterial roads, relying on complete historical data, cannot be employed directly. Aiming at solving this problem, we propose a multi-view road speed prediction framework. In the first view, temporal patterns are modeled by a layered hidden Markov model; and in the second view, spatial patterns are modeled by a collective matrix factorization model. The two models are learned and inferred simultaneously in a co-regularized manner. Experiments conducted in the Beijing road network, based on 10K taxi signals in 2 years, have demonstrated that the approach outperforms traditional approaches by 10% in MAE and RMSE.",AAAI
A Taxi Order Dispatch Model based On Combinatorial Optimization,2017,"Taxi-booking apps have been very popular all over the world as they provide convenience such as fast response time to the users. The key component of a taxi-booking app is the dispatch system which aims to provide optimal matches between drivers and riders. Traditional dispatch systems sequentially dispatch taxis to riders and aim to maximize the driver acceptance rate for each individual order. However, the traditional systems may lead to a low global success rate, which degrades the rider experience when using the app. In this paper, we propose a novel system that attempts to optimally dispatch taxis to serve multiple bookings. The proposed system aims to maximize the global success rate, thus it optimizes the overall travel efficiency, leading to enhanced user experience. To further enhance users' experience, we also propose a method to predict destinations of a user once the taxi-booking APP is started. The proposed method employs the Bayesian framework to model the distribution of a user's destination based on his/her travel histories.
 We use rigorous A/B tests to compare our new taxi dispatch method with state-of-the-art models using data collected in Beijing. Experimental results show that the proposed method is significantly better than other state-of-the art models in terms of global success rate (increased from 80% to 84%). Moreover, we have also achieved significant improvement on other metrics such as user's waiting-time and pick-up distance. For our destination prediction algorithm, we show that our proposed model is superior to the baseline model by improving the top-3 accuracy from 89% to 93%. The proposed taxi dispatch and destination prediction algorithms are both deployed in our online systems and serve tens of millions of users everyday.",KDD
Learning to Minimise Regret in Route Choice (Page 846),2017,"Reinforcement learning (RL) is a challenging task, especially in highly competitive multiagent scenarios. We consider the route choice problem, in which self-interested drivers aim at choosing routes that minimise their travel times. Employing RL here is challenging because agents must adapt to each others' decisions. In this paper, we investigate how agents can overcome such condition by minimising the regret associated with their decisions. Regret measures how much worse an agent performs on average compared to the best fixed action in hindsight. We present a simple yet effective regret-minimising algorithm to address this scenario. To this regard, we introduce the \textit{action regret}, which measures the performance of each route in comparison to the best one, and employ it as reinforcement signal. Given that agents do not know the cost of all routes (except for the currently taken ones) in advance, we also devise a method through which they can \textit{estimate} the action regret. We analyse the theoretical properties of our method and prove it minimises the agents' regret by means of the action regret. Furthermore, we provide formal guarantees on the agents' convergence to a $\lettereq$-approximate User Equilibrium, where $\lettereq$ is the bound on the agents' regret. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in which RL-agents are formally proven to converge to an approximate UE, without further assumptions, in the context of route choice.",AAMAS
Actor-Agent Application for Train Driver Rescheduling,2009,"This paper describes the design, implementation, visualizations, results and lessons learned of a novel real-world socio-technical research system for the purpose of rescheduling train drivers in the event of disruptions. The research system is structured according to the Actor-Agent paradigm: here agents assist in rescheduling tasks of train drivers. Coordination between agents is based on a team formation process in which possible rescheduling alternatives can be evaluated, based on constraints and preferences of involved human train drivers and dispatchers. The research system is the result of cooperation on decentralised multi-agent crew rescheduling between Netherlands Railways (NS) and the D-CIS Lab. The implementation is realized using the Cougaar framework and includes actual timetable and rolling stock schedule data and driver duty data.",AAMAS
Advice Provision for Energy Saving in Automobile Climate Control Systems,2014,"Reducing energy consumption of climate control systems is important in order to reduce human environmental footprint. The need to save energy becomes even greater when considering an electric car, since heavy use of the climate control system may exhaust the battery. In this paper we consider a method for an automated agent to provide advice to drivers which will motivate them to reduce the energy consumption of their climate control unit. Our approach takes into account both the energy consumption of the climate control system and the expected comfort level of the driver. We therefore build two models, one for assessing the energy consumption of the climate control system as a function of the system's settings, and the other, models human comfort level as a function of the climate control system's settings. Using these models, the agent provides advice to the driver considering how to set the climate control system. The agent advises settings which try to preserve a high level of comfort while consuming as little energy as possible. We empirically show that drivers equipped with our agent which provides them with advice significantly save energy as compared to drivers not equipped with our agent.",AAAI
Two-Sided Fairness for Repeated Matchings in Two-Sided Markets: A Case Study of a Ride-Hailing Platform,2019,"Ride hailing platforms, such as Uber, Lyft, Ola or DiDi, have traditionally focused on the satisfaction of the passengers, or on boosting successful business transactions. However, recent studies provide a multitude of reasons to worry about the drivers in the ride hailing ecosystem. The concerns range from bad working conditions and worker manipulation to discrimination against minorities. With the sharing economy ecosystem growing, more and more drivers financially depend on online platforms and their algorithms to secure a living. It is pertinent to ask what a fair distribution of income on such platforms is and what power and means the platform has in shaping these distributions.
 In this paper, we analyze job assignments of a major taxi company and observe that there is significant inequality in the driver income distribution. We propose a novel framework to think about fairness in the matching mechanisms of ride hailing platforms. Specifically, our notion of fairness relies on the idea that, spread over time, all drivers should receive benefits proportional to the amount of time they are active in the platform. We postulate that by not requiring every match to be fair, but rather distributing fairness over time, we can achieve better overall benefit for the drivers and the passengers. We experiment with various optimization problems and heuristics to explore the means of achieving two-sided fairness, and investigate their caveats and side-effects. Overall, our work takes the first step towards rethinking fairness in ride hailing platforms with an additional emphasis on the well-being of drivers.",KDD
Fast Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Interval Consistent Graph for Driving Behavior Prediction,2017,"Maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (MaxEnt IRL) is an effective approach for learning the underlying rewards of demonstrated human behavior, while it is intractable in high-dimensional state space due to the exponential growth of calculation cost. In recent years, a few works on approximating MaxEnt IRL in large state spaces by graphs provide successful results, however, types of state space models are quite limited. In this work, we extend them to more generic large state space models with graphs where time interval consistency of Markov decision processes are guaranteed. We validate our proposed method in the context of driving behavior prediction. Experimental results using actual driving data confirm the superiority of our algorithm in both prediction performance and computational cost over other existing IRL frameworks.",AAAI
Failure-Scenario Maker for Rule-Based Agent using Multi-agent Adversarial Reinforcement Learning and its Application to Autonomous Driving,2019,"We examine the problem of adversarial reinforcement learning for multi-agent domains including a rule-based agent. Rule-based algorithms are required in safety-critical applications for them to work properly in a wide range of situations. Hence, every effort is made to find failure scenarios during the development phase. However, as the software becomes complicated, finding failure cases becomes difficult. Especially in multi-agent domains, such as autonomous driving environments, it is much harder to find useful failure scenarios that help us improve the algorithm. We propose a method for efficiently finding failure scenarios; this method trains the adversarial agents using multi-agent reinforcement learning such that the tested rule-based agent fails. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method using a simple environment and autonomous driving simulator.",IJCAI
Anomalous window discovery through scan statistics for linear intersecting paths (SSLIP),2009,"Anomalous windows are the contiguous groupings of data points. In this paper, we propose an approach for discovering anomalous windows using Scan Statistics for Linear Intersecting Paths (SSLIP). A linear path refers to a path represented by a line with a single dimensional spatial coordinate marking an observation point. Our approach for discovering anomalous windows along linear paths comprises of the following distinct steps: (a) Cross Path Discovery: where we identify a subset of intersecting paths to be considered, (b) Anomalous Window Discovery: where we outline three order invariant algorithms, namely SSLIP, Brute Force-SSLIP and Central Brute Force-SSLIP, for the traversal of the cross paths to identify varying size directional windows along the paths. For identifying an anomalous window we compute an unusualness metric, in the form of a likelihood ratio to indicate the degree of unusualness of this window with respect to the rest of the data. We identify the window with the highest likelihood ratio as our anomalous window, and (c) Monte Carlo Simulations: to ascertain whether this window is truly anomalous and not just a random occurrence we perform hypothesis testing by computing a p-value using Monte Carlo Simulations. We present extensive experimental results in real world accident datasets for various highways with known issues(code and data available from [27], [21]). Our results show that our approach indeed is effective in identifying anomalous traffic accident windows along multiple intersecting highways.",KDD
State-Sharing Sparse Hidden Markov Models for Personalized Sequences,2019,"Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a powerful tool that has been widely adopted in sequence modeling tasks, such as mobility analysis, healthcare informatics, and online recommendation. However, using HMM for modeling personalized sequences remains a challenging problem: training a unified HMM with all the sequences often fails to uncover interesting personalized patterns; yet training one HMM for each individual inevitably suffers from data scarcity. We address this challenge by proposing a state-sharing sparse hidden Markov model (S3HMM) that can uncover personalized sequential patterns without suffering from data scarcity. This is achieved by two design principles: (1) all the HMMs in the ensemble share the same set of latent states; and (2) each HMM has its own transition matrix to model the personalized transitions. The result optimization problem for S3HMM becomes nontrivial, because of its two-layer hidden state design and the non-convexity in parameter estimation. We design a new Expectation-Maximization algorithm based, which treats the difference of convex programming as a sub-solver to optimize the non-convex function in the M-step with convergence guarantee. Our experimental results show that, S3HMM can successfully uncover personalized sequential patterns in various applications and outperforms baselines significantly in downstream prediction tasks.",KDD
Talent Circle Detection in Job Transition Networks,2016,"With the high mobility of talent, it becomes critical for the recruitment team to find the right talent from the right source in an efficient manner. The prevalence of Online Professional Networks (OPNs), such as LinkedIn, enables the new paradigm for talent recruitment and job search. However, the dynamic and complex nature of such talent information imposes significant challenges to identify prospective talent sources from large-scale professional networks. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to create a job transition network where vertices stand for organizations and a directed edge represents the talent flow between two organizations for a time period. By analyzing this job transition network, it is able to extract talent circles in a way such that every circle includes the organizations with similar talent exchange patterns. Then, the characteristics of these talent circles can be used for talent recruitment and job search. To this end, we develop a talent circle detection model and design the corresponding learning method by maximizing the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) of inferred probability for the edge existence based on edge weights. Then, the identified circles will be labeled by the representative organizations as well as keywords in job descriptions. Moreover, based on these identified circles, we develop a talent exchange prediction method for talent recommendation. Finally, we have performed extensive experiments on real-world data. The results show that, our method can achieve much higher modularity when comparing to the benchmark approaches, as well as high precision and recall for talent exchange prediction.",KDD
Multiagent-Based Route Guidance for Increasing the Chance of Arrival on Time,2016,"Transportation and mobility are central to sustainable urban development, where multiagent-based route guidance is widely applied. Traditional multiagent-based route guidance always seeks LET (least expected travel time) paths. However, drivers usually have specific expectations, i.e., tight or loose deadlines, which may not be all met by LET paths. We thus adopt and extend the probability tail model that aims to maximize the probability of reaching destinations before deadlines. Specifically, we propose a decentralized multiagent approach, where infrastructure agents locally collect intentions of concerned vehicle agents and formulate route guidance as a route assignment problem, to guarantee their arrival on time. Experimental results on real road networks justify its ability to increase the chance of arrival on time.",AAAI
WhereNext: a location predictor on trajectory pattern mining,2009,"The pervasiveness of mobile devices and location based services is leading to an increasing volume of mobility data.This side eect provides the opportunity for innovative methods that analyse the behaviors of movements. In this paper we propose WhereNext, which is a method aimed at predicting with a certain level of accuracy the next location of a moving object. The prediction uses previously extracted movement patterns named Trajectory Patterns, which are a concise representation of behaviors of moving objects as sequences of regions frequently visited with a typical travel time. A decision tree, named T-pattern Tree, is built and evaluated with a formal training and test process. The tree is learned from the Trajectory Patterns that hold a certain area and it may be used as a predictor of the next location of a new trajectory finding the best matching path in the tree. Three dierent best matching methods to classify a new moving object are proposed and their impact on the quality of prediction is studied extensively. Using Trajectory Patterns as predictive rules has the following implications: (I) the learning depends on the movement of all available objects in a certain area instead of on the individual history of an object; (II) the prediction tree intrinsically contains the spatio-temporal properties that have emerged from the data and this allows us to define matching methods that striclty depend on the properties of such movements. In addition, we propose a set of other measures, that evaluate a priori the predictive power of a set of Trajectory Patterns. This measures were tuned on a real life case study. Finally, an exhaustive set of experiments and results on the real dataset are presented.",KDD
Effective Management of Electric Vehicle Storage Using Smart Charging,2014,"The growing Electric Vehicles' (EVs) popularity among commuters creates new challenges for the smart grid. The most important of them is the uncoordinated EV charging that substantially increases the energy demand peaks, putting the smart grid under constant strain. In order to cope with these peaks the grid needs extra infrastructure, a costly solution. We propose an Adaptive Management of EV Storage (AMEVS) algorithm, implemented through a learning agent that acts on behalf of individual EV owners and schedules EV charging over a weekly horizon. It accounts for individual preferences so that mobility service is not violated but also individual benefit is maximized. We observe that it reshapes the energy demand making it less volatile so that fewer resources are needed to cover peaks. It assumes Vehicle-to-Grid discharging when the customer has excess capacity. Our agent uses Reinforcement Learning trained on real world data to learn individual household consumption behavior and to schedule EV charging. Unlike previous work, AMEVS is a fully distributed approach. We show that AMEVS achieves significant reshaping of the energy demand curve and peak reduction, which is correlated with customer preferences regarding perceived utility of energy availability. Additionally, we show that the average and peak energy prices are reduced as a result of smarter energy use.",AAAI
Efficient Region Embedding with Multi-View Spatial Networks: A Perspective of Locality-Constrained Spatial Autocorrelations,2019,"Urban regions are places where people live, work, consume, and entertain. In this study, we investigate the problem of learning an embedding space for regions. Studying the representations of regions can help us to better understand the patterns, structures, and dynamics of cities, support urban planning, and, ultimately, to make our cities more livable and sustainable. While some efforts have been made for learning the embeddings of regions, existing methods can be improved by incorporating locality-constrained spatial autocorrelations into an encode-decode framework. Such embedding strategy is capable of taking into account both intra-region structural information and inter-region spatial autocorrelations. To this end, we propose to learn the representations of regions via a new embedding strategy with awareness of locality-constrained spatial autocorrelations. Specifically, we first construct multi-view (i.e., distance and mobility connectivity) POI-POI networks to represent regions. In addition, we introduce two properties into region embedding: (i) spatial autocorrelations: a global similarity between regions; (ii) top-k locality: spatial autocorrelations locally and approximately reside on top k most autocorrelated regions. We propose a new encoder-decoder based formulation that preserves the two properties while remaining efficient. As an application, we exploit the learned embeddings to predict the mobile checkin popularity of regions. Finally, extensive experiments with real-world urban region data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.",AAAI
An Algorithm to Coordinate Measurements Using Stochastic Human Mobility Patterns in Large-Scale Participatory Sensing Settings,2016,"Participatory sensing is a promising new low-cost approach for collecting environmental data. However, current large-scale environmental participatory sensing campaigns typically do not coordinate the measurements of participants, which can lead to gaps or redundancy in the collected data. While some work has considered this problem, it has made several unrealistic assumptions. In particular, it assumes that complete and accurate knowledge about the participants future movements is available and it does not consider constraints on the number of measurements a user is willing to take. To address these shortcomings, we develop a computationally-efficient coordination algorithm (Best-match) to suggest to users where and when to take measurements. Our algorithm exploits human mobility patterns, but explicitly considers the inherent uncertainty of these patterns. We empirically evaluate our algorithm on a real-world human mobility and air quality dataset and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art greedy and pull-based proximity algorithms in dynamic environments.",AAAI
Learning geographical preferences for point-of-interest recommendation,2013,"The problem of point of interest (POI) recommendation is to provide personalized recommendations of places of interests, such as restaurants, for mobile users. Due to its complexity and its connection to location based social networks (LBSNs), the decision process of a user choose a POI is complex and can be influenced by various factors, such as user preferences, geographical influences, and user mobility behaviors. While there are some studies on POI recommendations, it lacks of integrated analysis of the joint effect of multiple factors. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel geographical probabilistic factor analysis framework which strategically takes various factors into consideration. Specifically, this framework allows to capture the geographical influences on a user's check-in behavior. Also, the user mobility behaviors can be effectively exploited in the recommendation model. Moreover, the recommendation model can effectively make use of user check-in count data as implicity user feedback for modeling user preferences. Finally, experimental results on real-world LBSNs data show that the proposed recommendation method outperforms state-of-the-art latent factor models with a significant margin.",KDD
Mining mobility user profiles for car pooling,2011,"In this paper we introduce a methodology for extracting mobility profiles of individuals from raw digital traces (in particular, GPS traces), and study criteria to match individuals based on profiles. We instantiate the profile matching problem to a specific application context, namely proactive car pooling services, and therefore develop a matching criterion that satisfies various basic constraints obtained from the background knowledge of the application domain. In order to evaluate the impact and robustness of the methods introduced, two experiments are reported, which were performed on a massive dataset containing GPS traces of private cars: (i) the impact of the car pooling application based on profile matching is measured, in terms of percentage shareable traffic; (ii) the approach is adapted to coarser-grained mobility data sources that are nowadays commonly available from telecom operators. In addition the ensuing loss in precision and coverage of profile matches is measured.",KDD
Regularity and Conformity: Location Prediction Using Heterogeneous Mobility Data,2015,"Mobility prediction enables appealing proactive experiences for location-aware services and offers essential intelligence to business and governments. Recent studies suggest that human mobility is highly regular and predictable. Additionally, social conformity theory indicates that people's movements are influenced by others. However, existing approaches for location prediction fail to organically combine both the regularity and conformity of human mobility in a unified model, and lack the capacity to incorporate heterogeneous mobility datasets to boost prediction performance. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose a hybrid predictive model integrating both the regularity and conformity of human mobility as well as their mutual reinforcement. In addition, we further elevate the predictive power of our model by learning location profiles from heterogeneous mobility datasets based on a gravity model. We evaluate the proposed model using several city-scale mobility datasets including location check-ins, GPS trajectories of taxis, and public transit data. The experimental results validate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for mobility prediction in terms of multiple metrics such as accuracy and percentile rank. The results also suggest that the predictability of human mobility is time-varying, e.g., the overall predictability is higher on workdays than holidays while predicting users' unvisited locations is more challenging for workdays than holidays.",KDD
Efficiently Optimizing for Dendritic Connectivity on Tree-Structured Networks in a Multi-Objective Framework,2018,"We provide an exact and approximation algorithm based on Dynamic Programming and an approximation algorithm based on Mixed Integer Programming for optimizing for the so-called dendritic connectivity on tree-structured networks in a multi-objective setting. Dendritic connectivity describes the degree of connectedness of a network. We consider different variants of dendritic connectivity to capture both network connectivity with respect to long and short-to-middle distances. Our work is motivated by a problem in computational sustainability concerning the evaluation of trade-offs in ecosystem services due to the proliferation of hydropower dams throughout the Amazon basin. In particular, we consider trade-offs between energy production and river connectivity. River fragmentation can dramatically affect fish migrations and other ecosystem services, such as navigation and transportation. In the context of river networks, different variants of dendritic connectivity are important to characterize the movements of different fish species and human populations. Our approaches are general and can be applied to optimizing for dendritic connectivity for a variety of multi-objective problems on tree-structured networks.",COMPASS
Hydra: A Personalized and Context-Aware Multi-Modal Transportation Recommendation System,2019,"Transportation recommendation is one important map service in navigation applications. Previous transportation recommendation solutions fail to deliver satisfactory user experience because their recommendations only consider routes in one transportation mode (uni-modal, e.g., taxi, bus, cycle) and largely overlook situational context. In this work, we propose Hydra, a recommendation system that offers multi-modal transportation planning and is adaptive to various situational context (e.g., nearby point-of-interest (POI) distribution and weather). We leverage the availability of existing routing engines and big urban data, and design a novel two-level framework that integrates uni-modal and multi-modal (e.g., taxi-bus, bus-cycle) routes as well as heterogeneous urban data for intelligent multi-modal transportation recommendation. In addition to urban context features constructed from multi-source urban data, we learn the latent representations of users, origin-destination (OD) pairs and transportation modes based on user implicit feedbacks, which captures the collaborative transportation mode preferences of users and OD pairs. A gradient boosting tree based model is then introduced to recommend the proper route among various uni-modal and multi-modal transportation routes. We also optimize the framework to support real-time, large-scale route query and recommendation. We deploy Hydra on Baidu Maps, one of the world's largest map services. Real-world urban-scale experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed system. Since its deployment in August 2018, Hydra has answered over a hundred million route recommendation queries made by over ten million distinct users with 82.8% relative improvement of user click ratio.",KDD
Learning to Follow Navigational Route Instructions,2009,"We have developed a simulation model that accepts instructions in unconstrained natural language, and then guides a robot to the correct destination. The instructions are segmented on the basis of the actions to be taken, and each segment is labeled with the required action. This flat formulation reduces the problem to a sequential labeling task, to which machine learning methods are applied. We propose an innovativemachine learningmethod for explicitly modeling the actions described in instructions and integrating learning and inference about the physical environment. We obtained a corpus of 840 route instructions that experimenters verified as follow-able, given by people in building navigation situations. Using the four-fold cross validation, our experiments showed that the simulated robot reached the correct destination 88% of the time.",IJCAI
Hard to Park?: Estimating Parking Difficulty at Scale,2019,"In this paper we consider the problem of estimating the difficulty of parking at a particular time and place; this problem is a critical sub-component for any system providing parking assistance to users.

We present a wide range of features intended to capture different aspects of parking difficulty and study their effectiveness both alone and in combination. We also evaluate various model architectures for the prediction problem. Finally, we present challenges faced in estimating parking difficulty in different regions of the world, and the approaches we have taken to address them.",KDD
New algorithms for parking demand management and a city-scale deployment,2014,"On-street parking, just as any publicly owned utility, is used inefficiently if access is free or priced very far from market rates. This paper introduces a novel demand management solution: using data from dedicated occupancy sensors an iteration scheme updates parking rates to better match demand. The new rates encourage parkers to avoid peak hours and peak locations and reduce congestion and underuse. The solution is deliberately simple so that it is easy to understand, easily seen to be fair and leads to parking policies that are easy to remember and act upon. We study the convergence properties of the iteration scheme and prove that it converges to a reasonable distribution for a very large class of models. The algorithm is in use to change parking rates in over 6000 spaces in downtown Los Angeles since June 2012 as part of the LA Express Park project. Initial results are encouraging with a reduction of congestion and underuse, while in more locations rates were decreased than increased.",KDD
Predicting Fuel Consumption and Flight Delays for Low-Cost Airlines,2017,"Low-cost airlines (LCAs) represent a new category of airlines that provides low-fare flights. The rise and growth of LCAs has intensified the price competition among airlines, and LCAs require continuous efforts to reduce their operating costs to lower flight prices; however, LCA passengers still demand high-quality services. A common measure of airline service quality is on-time departure performance. Be- cause LCAs apply efficient aircraft utilization and the time between flights is likely to be small, additional effort is required to avoid flight delays and improve their service quality. In this paper, we apply state-of-the-art predictive modeling approaches to real airline datasets and investigate the feasibility of machine learning methods for cost reduction and service quality improvement in LCAs. We address two prediction problems: fuel consumption prediction and flight delay prediction. We train predictive models using flight and passenger information, and our experiment results show that our regression model predicts the amount of fuel consumption more accurately than flight dispatchers, and our binary classifier achieves an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.75 for predicting a delay of a specific flight route.",AAAI
Sample Adaptive Multiple Kernel Learning for Failure Prediction of Railway Points,2019,"Railway points are among the key components of railway infrastructure. As a part of signal equipment, points control the routes of trains at railway junctions, having a significant impact on the reliability, capacity, and punctuality of rail transport. Meanwhile, they are also one of the most fragile parts in railway systems. Points failures cause a large portion of railway incidents. Traditionally, maintenance of points is based on a fixed time interval or raised after the equipment failures. Instead, it would be of great value if we could forecast points' failures and take action beforehand, minimising any negative effect. To date, most of the existing prediction methods are either lab-based or relying on specially installed sensors which makes them infeasible for large-scale implementation. Besides, they often use data from only one source. We, therefore, explore a new way that integrates multi-source data which are ready to hand to fulfil this task. We conducted our case study based on Sydney Trains rail network which is an extensive network of passenger and freight railways. Unfortunately, the real-world data are usually incomplete due to various reasons, e.g., faults in the database, operational errors or transmission faults. Besides, railway points differ in their locations, types and some other properties, which means it is hard to use a unified model to predict their failures. Aiming at this challenging task, we firstly constructed a dataset from multiple sources and selected key features with the help of domain experts. In this paper, we formulate our prediction task as a multiple kernel learning problem with missing kernels. We present a robust multiple kernel learning algorithm for predicting points failures. Our model takes into account the missing pattern of data as well as the inherent variance on different sets of railway points. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm compared with other state-of-the-art methods.",KDD
Data-Driven Simulation and Optimization for Incident Response in Urban Railway Networks (Page 819),2017,"In this article we introduce an integrated agent-based train, passenger and incident simulation engine for data-driven incident response in urban railway networks. We model the movement of passengers and trains as individual agents behaving according to parsimonious models defined by data availability. Appropriate statistical routines are implemented for model calibration. We also design a generic incident model appropriate for typical localized mechanical failure scenarios in which the transport supply is adversely impacted in a short spatio-temporal window. Given the brief and localized nature of these events, a mathematical programming formulation is proposed, which computes the optimal action plan for a specific incident. The set of action plans considered includes re-scheduling existing train services as well as running temporary services. The numerical performance of the simulation engine is presented using a large dataset of real anonymized smart card data. The results of the proposed optimization framework are then evaluated using real incident scenarios.",AAMAS
A Deep Value-network Based Approach for Multi-Driver Order Dispatching,2019,"Recent works on ride-sharing order dispatching have highlighted the importance of taking into account both the spatial and temporal dynamics in the dispatching process for improving the transportation system efficiency. At the same time, deep reinforcement learning has advanced to the point where it achieves superhuman performance in a number of fields. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based solution for order dispatching and we conduct large scale online A/B tests on DiDi's ride-dispatching platform to show that the proposed method achieves significant improvement on both total driver income and user experience related metrics.
 In particular, we model the ride dispatching problem as a Semi Markov Decision Process to account for the temporal aspect of the dispatching actions. To improve the stability of the value iteration with nonlinear function approximators like neural networks, we propose Cerebellar Value Networks (CVNet) with a novel distributed state representation layer. We further derive a regularized policy evaluation scheme for CVNet that penalizes large Lipschitz constant of the value network for additional robustness against adversarial perturbation and noises. Finally, we adapt various transfer learning methods to CVNet for increased learning adaptability and efficiency across multiple cities. We conduct extensive offline simulations based on real dispatching data as well as online AB tests through the DiDi's platform. Results show that CVNet consistently outperforms other recently proposed dispatching methods. We finally show that the performance can be further improved through the efficient use of transfer learning.",KDD
Efficient Large-Scale Fleet Management via Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning,2018,"Large-scale online ride-sharing platforms have substantially transformed our lives by reallocating transportation resources to alleviate traffic congestion and promote transportation efficiency. An efficient fleet management strategy not only can significantly improve the utilization of transportation resources but also increase the revenue and customer satisfaction. It is a challenging task to design an effective fleet management strategy that can adapt to an environment involving complex dynamics between demand and supply. Existing studies usually work on a simplified problem setting that can hardly capture the complicated stochastic demand-supply variations in high-dimensional space. In this paper we propose to tackle the large-scale fleet management problem using reinforcement learning, and propose a contextual multi-agent reinforcement learning framework including two concrete algorithms, namely contextual deep Q-learning and contextual multi-agent actor-critic, to achieve explicit coordination among a large number of agents adaptive to different contexts.

Algorithms for Trip-Vehicle Assignment in Ride-Sharing,2018,"We investigate the ride-sharing assignment problem from an algorithmic resource allocation point of view. Given a number of requests with source and destination locations, and a number of available car locations, the task is to assign cars to requests with two requests sharing one car. We formulate this as a combinatorial optimization problem, and show that it is NP-hard. We then design an approximation algorithm which guarantees to output a solution with at most 2.5 times the optimal cost. Experiments are conducted showing that our algorithm actually has a much better approximation ratio (around 1.2) on synthetically generated data.",AAAI
Co-Prediction of Multiple Transportation Demands Based on Deep Spatio-Temporal Neural Network,2019,"Taxi and sharing bike bring great convenience to urban transportation. A lot of efforts have been made to improve the efficiency of taxi service or bike sharing system by predicting the next-period pick-up or drop-off demand. Different from the existing research, this paper is motivated by the following two facts: 1) From a micro view, an observed spatial demand at any time slot could be decomposed as a combination of many hidden spatial demand bases; 2) From a macro view, the multiple transportation demands are strongly correlated with each other, both spatially and temporally. Definitely, the above two views have great potential to revolutionize the existing taxi or bike demand prediction methods. Along this line, this paper provides a novel Co-prediction method based on Spatio-Temporal neural Network, namely, CoST-Net. In particular, a deep convolutional neural network is constructed to decompose a spatial demand into a combination of hidden spatial demand bases. The combination weight vector is used as a representation of the decomposed spatial demand. Then, a heterogeneous Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is proposed to integrate the states of multiple transportation demands, and also model the dynamics of them mixedly. Last, the environmental features such as humidity and temperature are incorporated with the achieved overall hidden states to predict the multiple demands simultaneously. Experiments have been conducted on real-world taxi and sharing bike demand data, results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over both classical and the state-of-the-art transportation demand prediction methods.",KDD
Multi-User Mobile Sequential Recommendation: An Efficient Parallel Computing Paradigm,2018,"The classic mobile sequential recommendation (MSR) problem aims to provide the optimal route to taxi drivers for minimizing the potential travel distance before they meet next passengers. However, the problem is designed from the view of a single user and may lead to overlapped recommendations and cause traffic problems. Existing approaches usually contain an offline pruning process with extremely high computational cost, given a large number of pick-up points. To this end, we formalize a new multi-user MSR (MMSR) problem that locates optimal routes for a group of drivers with different starting positions. We develop two efficient methods, PSAD and PSAD-M, for solving the MMSR problem by ganging parallel computing and simulated annealing. Our methods outperform several existing approaches, especially for high-dimensional MMSR problems, with a record-breaking performance of 180x speedup using 384 cores.",KDD
REST: A Reference-based Framework for Spatio-temporal Trajectory Compression,2018,"The pervasiveness of GPS-enabled devices and wireless communication technologies results in massive trajectory data, incurring expensive cost for storage, transmission, and query processing. To relieve this problem, in this paper we propose a novel framework for compressing trajectory data, REST (Reference-based Spatio-temporal trajectory compression), by which a raw trajectory is represented by concatenation of a series of historical (sub-)trajectories (called reference trajectories) that form the compressed trajectory within a given spatio-temporal deviation threshold. In order to construct a reference trajectory set that can most benefit the subsequent compression, we propose three kinds of techniques to select reference trajectories wisely from a large dataset such that the resulting reference set is more compact yet covering most footprints of trajectories in the area of interest. To address the computational issue caused by the large number of combinations of reference trajectories that may exist for resembling a given trajectory, we propose efficient greedy algorithms that run in the blink of an eye and dynamic programming algorithms that can achieve the optimal compression ratio. Compared to existing work on trajectory compression, our framework has few assumptions about data such as moving within a road network or moving with constant direction and speed, and better compression performance with fairly small spatio-temporal loss. Extensive experiments on a real taxi trajectory dataset demonstrate the superiority of our framework over existing representative approaches in terms of both compression ratio and efficiency.",KDD
Optimizing Efficiency of Taxi Systems: Scaling-up and Handling Arbitrary Constraints (Page 523),2015,"Taxi service is an indispensable part of public transport in modern cities. However, due to its decentralized operation mode, taxi services in many cities are inefficient. Besides, the decentralized nature also poses significant challenges to analyzing and regulating taxi services. State of the art computational methods for optimizing taxi market efficiency suffer from two important limitations: 1) they cannot be scaled up efficiently; and 2) they cannot address complex real-world market situations where additional scheduling constraints need to be handled. In this paper, we propose two novel algorithms--FLORA and FLORA-A--to address the inadequacies. Using convex polytope representation techniques, FLORA provides a fully compact representation for taxi drivers' strategy space and scales up more efficiently than existing algorithms. FLORA-A avoids enumerating the entire exponentially large pure strategy space by gradually expanding the strategy space. It is the first known method capable of handling arbitrary scheduling constraints for optimizing taxi system efficiency. Experimental results show orders of magnitude improvement in speed FLORA provides, and the necessity of using FLORA-A as suggested by changes in the taxi drivers' operation strategy under different market conditions.",AAMAS
Taxi Driving Behavior Analysis in Latent Vehicle-to-Vehicle Networks: A Social Influence Perspective,2016,"With recent advances in mobile and sensor technologies, a large amount of efforts have been made on developing intelligent applications for taxi drivers, which provide beneficial guide and opportunity to improve the profit and work efficiency. However, limited scopes focus on the latent social interaction within cab drivers, and corresponding social propagation scheme to share driving behaviors has been largely ignored. To that end, in this paper, we propose a comprehensive study to reveal how the social propagation affects for better prediction of cab drivers' future behaviors. To be specific, we first investigate the correlation between drivers' skills and their mutual interactions in the latent vehicle-to-vehicle network, which intuitively indicates the effects of social influences. Along this line, by leveraging the classic social influence theory, we develop a two-stage framework for quantitatively revealing the latent driving pattern propagation within taxi drivers. Comprehensive experiments on a real-word data set collected from the New York City clearly validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework on predicting future taxi driving behaviors, which also support the hypothesis that social factors indeed improve the predictability of driving behaviors.",KDD
Route Recommendations for Idle Taxi Drivers: Find Me the Shortest Route to a Customer!,2018,"We study the problem of route recommendation to idle taxi drivers such that the distance between the taxi and an anticipated customer request is minimized. Minimizing the distance to the next anticipated customer leads to more productivity for the taxi driver and less waiting time for the customer. To anticipate when and where future customer requests are likely to come from and accordingly recom- mend routes, we develop a route recommendation engine called MDM: Minimizing Distance through Monte Carlo Tree Search. In contrast to existing techniques, MDM employs a continuous learning platform where the underlying model to predict future customer requests is dynamically updated. Extensive experiments on real taxi data from New York and San Francisco reveal that MDM is up to 70% better than the state of the art and robust to anomalous events such as concerts, sporting events, etc.",KDD
SCRAM: A Sharing Considered Route Assignment Mechanism for Fair Taxi Route Recommendations,2015,"Recommending routes for a group of competing taxi drivers is almost untouched in most route recommender systems. For this kind of problem, recommendation fairness and driving efficiency are two fundamental aspects. In the paper, we propose SCRAM, a sharing considered route assignment mechanism for fair taxi route recommendations. SCRAM aims to provide recommendation fairness for a group of competing taxi drivers, without sacrificing driving efficiency. By designing a concise route assignment mechanism, SCRAM achieves better recommendation fairness for competing taxis. By considering the sharing of road sections to avoid unnecessary competition, SCRAM is more efficient in terms of driving cost per customer (DCC). We test SCRAM based on a large number of historical taxi trajectories and validate the recommendation fairness and driving efficiency of SCRAM with extensive evaluations. Experimental results show that SCRAM achieves better recommendation fairness and higher driving efficiency than three compared approaches.",KDD
A cost-effective recommender system for taxi drivers,2014,"The GPS technology and new forms of urban geography have changed the paradigm for mobile services. As such, the abundant availability of GPS traces has enabled new ways of doing taxi business. Indeed, recent efforts have been made on developing mobile recommender systems for taxi drivers using Taxi GPS traces. These systems can recommend a sequence of pick-up points for the purpose of maximizing the probability of identifying a customer with the shortest driving distance. However, in the real world, the income of taxi drivers is strongly correlated with the effective driving hours. In other words, it is more critical for taxi drivers to know the actual driving routes to minimize the driving time before finding a customer. To this end, in this paper, we propose to develop a cost-effective recommender system for taxi drivers. The design goal is to maximize their profits when following the recommended routes for finding passengers. Specifically, we first design a net profit objective function for evaluating the potential profits of the driving routes. Then, we develop a graph representation of road networks by mining the historical taxi GPS traces and provide a Brute-Force strategy to generate optimal driving route for recommendation. However, a critical challenge along this line is the high computational cost of the graph based approach. Therefore, we develop a novel recursion strategy based on the special form of the net profit function for searching optimal candidate routes efficiently. Particularly, instead of recommending a sequence of pick-up points and letting the driver decide how to get to those points, our recommender system is capable of providing an entire driving route, and the drivers are able to find a customer for the largest potential profit by following the recommendations. This makes our recommender system more practical and profitable than other existing recommender systems. Finally, we carry out extensive experiments on a real-world data set collected from the San Francisco Bay area and the experimental results clearly validate the effectiveness of the proposed recommender system.",KDD
Optimal Pricing for Improving Efficiency of Taxi Systems,2013,"In Beijing, most taxi drivers intentionally avoid working during peak hours despite of the huge customer demand within these peak periods. This dilemma is mainly due to the fact that taxi drivers' congestion costs are not reflected in the current taxi fare structure. To resolve this problem, we propose a new pricing scheme to provide taxi drivers with extra incentives to work during peak hours. This differs from previous studies of taxi market by considering market variance over multiple periods, taxi drivers' profit-driven decisions, and their scheduling constraints regarding the interdependence among different periods. The major challenge of this research is the computational intensiveness to identify optimal strategy due to the exponentially large size of a taxi driver's strategy space and the scheduling constraints. We develop an atom schedule method to overcome these issues. It reduces the magnitude of the problem while satisfying the constraints to filter out infeasible pure strategies. Simulation results based on real data show the effectiveness of the proposed methods, which opens up a new door to improving the efficiency of taxi market in megacities (e.g., Beijing).",IJCAI
"Mining large-scale, sparse GPS traces for map inference: comparison of approaches",2012,"We address the problem of inferring road maps from large-scale GPS traces that have relatively low resolution and sampling frequency. Unlike past published work that requires high-resolution traces with dense sampling, we focus on situations with coarse granularity data, such as that obtained from thousands of taxis in Shanghai, which transmit their location as seldom as once per minute. Such data sources can be made available inexpensively as byproducts of existing processes, rather than having to drive every road with high-quality GPS instrumentation just for map building - and having to re-drive roads for periodic updates. Although the challenges in using opportunistic probe data are significant, successful mining algorithms could potentially enable the creation of continuously updated maps at very low cost.
 In this paper, we compare representative algorithms from two approaches: working with individual reported locations vs. segments between consecutive locations. We assess their trade-offs and effectiveness in both qualitative and quantitative comparisons for regions of Shanghai and Chicago.",KDD
Contextual Intent Tracking for Personal Assistants,2016,"A new paradigm of recommendation is emerging in intelligent personal assistants such as Apple's Siri, Google Now, and Microsoft Cortana, which recommends ""the right information at the right time"" and proactively helps you ""get things done"". This type of recommendation requires precisely tracking users' contemporaneous intent, i.e., what type of information (e.g., weather, stock prices) users currently intend to know, and what tasks (e.g., playing music, getting taxis) they intend to do. Users' intent is closely related to context, which includes both external environments such as time and location, and users' internal activities that can be sensed by personal assistants. The relationship between context and intent exhibits complicated co-occurring and sequential correlation, and contextual signals are also heterogeneous and sparse, which makes modeling the context intent relationship a challenging task. To solve the intent tracking problem, we propose the Kalman filter regularized PARAFAC2 (KP2) nowcasting model, which compactly represents the structure and co-movement of context and intent. The KP2 model utilizes collaborative capabilities among users, and learns for each user a personalized dynamic system that enables efficient nowcasting of users' intent. Extensive experiments using real-world data sets from a commercial personal assistant show that the KP2 model significantly outperforms various methods, and provides inspiring implications for deploying large-scale proactive recommendation systems in personal assistants.",KDD
The Simpler The Better: A Unified Approach to Predicting Original Taxi Demands based on Large-Scale Online Platforms,2017,"Taxi-calling apps are gaining increasing popularity for their efficiency in dispatching idle taxis to passengers in need. To precisely balance the supply and the demand of taxis, online taxicab platforms need to predict the Unit Original Taxi Demand (UOTD), which refers to the number of taxi-calling requirements submitted per unit time (e.g., every hour) and per unit region (e.g., each POI). Predicting UOTD is non-trivial for large-scale industrial online taxicab platforms because both accuracy and flexibility are essential. Complex non-linear models such as GBRT and deep learning are generally accurate, yet require labor-intensive model redesign after scenario changes (e.g., extra constraints due to new regulations). To accurately predict UOTD while remaining flexible to scenario changes, we propose LinUOTD, a unified linear regression model with more than 200 million dimensions of features. The simple model structure eliminates the need of repeated model redesign, while the high-dimensional features contribute to accurate UOTD prediction. We further design a series of optimization techniques for efficient model training and updating. Evaluations on two large-scale datasets from an industrial online taxicab platform verify that LinUOTD outperforms popular non-linear models in accuracy. We envision our experiences to adopt simple linear models with high-dimensional features in UOTD prediction as a pilot study and can shed insights upon other industrial large-scale spatio-temporal prediction problems.",KDD
Dynamic Electronic Toll Collection via Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning with Edge-Based Graph Convolutional Networks,2019,"Over the past decades, Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) systems have been proved the capability of alleviating traffic congestion in urban areas. Dynamic Electronic Toll Collection (DETC) was recently proposed to further improve the efficiency of ETC, where tolls are dynamically set based on traffic dynamics. However, computing the optimal DETC scheme is computationally difficult and existing approaches are limited to small scale or partial road networks, which significantly restricts the adoption of DETC. To this end, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) approach for DETC. We make several key contributions: i) an enhancement over the state-of-the-art RL-based method with a deep neural networkrepresentation of the policy and value functions and a temporal difference learning framework to accelerate the update of target values, ii) a novel edge-based graph convolutional neural network (eGCN) to extract the spatio-temporal correlations of the road network state features, iii) a novel cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) which divides the whole road network into partitions according to their geographic and economic characteristics and trains a tolling agent for each partition. Experimental results show that our approach can scale up to realistic-sized problems with robust performance and significantly outperform the state-of-the-art method.",IJCAI

Model Predictive Control with Uncertainty in Human Driven Systems,2013,"Human driven systems present a unique optimization challenge for robot control.Generally, operators of these systems behave rationally given environmental factors and desired goals.However, information available to subsystem controllers is often incomplete, and the operator becomes more difficult to model without this input information.In this work we present a data-driven, nonparametric model to capture both expectation and uncertainty of the upcoming duty for a subsystem controller.This model is a modified k-nearest neighbor regressor used to generate weighted samples from a distribution of upcoming duty, which are then exploited to generate an optimal control.We test the model on a simulated heterogeneous energy pack manager in an Electric Vehicle operated by a human driver.For this domain, upcoming load on the energy pack strongly affects the optimal use and charging strategy of the pack.Given incomplete information, there is a natural uncertainty in upcoming duty due to traffic, destination, signage, and other factors.We test against a dataset of real driving data gathered from volunteers, and compare the results other models and the optimal upper bound.",AAAI
Constructing popular routes from uncertain trajectories,2012,"The advances in location-acquisition technologies have led to a myriad of spatial trajectories. These trajectories are usually generated at a low or an irregular frequency due to applications' characteristics or energy saving, leaving the routes between two consecutive points of a single trajectory uncertain (called an uncertain trajectory). In this paper, we present a Route Inference framework based on Collective Knowledge (abbreviated as RICK) to construct the popular routes from uncertain trajectories. Explicitly, given a location sequence and a time span, the RICK is able to construct the top-k routes which sequentially pass through the locations within the specified time span, by aggregating such uncertain trajectories in a mutual reinforcement way (i.e., uncertain + uncertain Ã¢â â certain). Our work can benefit trip planning, traffic management, and animal movement studies. The RICK comprises two components: routable graph construction and route inference. First, we explore the spatial and temporal characteristics of uncertain trajectories and construct a routable graph by collaborative learning among the uncertain trajectories. Second, in light of the routable graph, we propose a routing algorithm to construct the top-k routes according to a user-specified query. We have conducted extensive experiments on two real datasets, consisting of Foursquare check-in datasets and taxi trajectories. The results show that RICK is both effective and efficient.",KDD
Traffic Measurement and Route Recommendation System for Mass Rapid Transit (MRT),2015,"Understanding how people use public transport is important for the operation and future planning of the underlying transport networks. We have therefore developed and deployed a traffic measurement system for a key player in the transportation industry to gain insights into crowd behavior for planning purposes. The system has been in operation for several months and reports, at hourly intervals, (1) the crowdedness of subway stations, (2) the flows of people inside interchange stations, and (3) the expected travel time for each possible route in the subway network of Singapore. The core of our system is an efficient algorithm which detects individual subway trips from anonymized real-time data generated by the location based system of Singtel, the country's largest telecommunications company. To assess the accuracy of our system, we engaged an independent market research company to conduct a field study--a manual count of the number of passengers boarding and disembarking at a selected station on three separate days. A strong correlation between the calculations of our algorithm and the manual counts was found. One of our key findings is that travelers do not always choose the route with the shortest travel time in the subway network of Singapore. We have therefore also been developing a mobile app which allows users to plan their trips based on the average travel time between stations.",KDD
How Agents Can Help Curbing Fuel Combustion â a Performance Study of Intersection Control for Fuel-Operated Vehicles,2011,"Traffic causes pollution and demands fuel. When it comes to vehicle traffic, intersections tend to be a main bottleneck. Traditional approaches to control traffic at intersections have not been designed to optimize any environmental criterion. Our objective is to design mechanisms for intersection control which minimize fuel consumption. This is difficult because it requires a specialized infrastructure: It must allow vehicles and intersections to communicate, e.g., vehicles send their dynamic characteristics (position, speed etc.) to the intersection more or less continuously so that it can estimate the fuel consumption. In this context, the use of software agents supports the driver by reducing the necessary degree of direct interaction with the intersection. In this paper, we quantify the fuel consumption with existing agent-based approaches for intersection control. Further, we propose a new, agent-based mechanism for intersection control, with minimization of fuel consumption as an explicit design objective. It reduces fuel consumption by up to 26% and waiting time by up to 98%, compared to traffic lights. Thus, agent-based mechanisms for intersection control may reduce fuel consumption in a way that is substantial.",AAMAS
Dual Averaging Method for Online Graph-structured Sparsity,2019,"Online learning algorithms update models via one sample per iteration, thus efficient to process large-scale datasets and useful to detect malicious events for social benefits, such as disease outbreak and traffic congestion on the fly. However, existing algorithms for graph-structured models focused on the offline setting and the least square loss, incapable for online setting, while methods designed for online setting cannot be directly applied to the problem of complex (usually non-convex) graph-structured sparsity model. To address these limitations, in this paper we propose a new algorithm for graph-structured sparsity constraint problems under online setting, which we call GraphDA. The key part in GraphDA is to project both averaging gradient (in dual space) and primal variables (in primal space) onto lower dimensional subspaces, thus capturing the graph-structured sparsity effectively. Furthermore, the objective functions assumed here are generally convex so as to handle different losses for online learning settings. To the best of our knowledge, GraphDA is the first online learning algorithm for graph-structure constrained optimization problems. To validate our method, we conduct extensive experiments on both benchmark graph and real-world graph datasets. Our experiment results show that, compared to other baseline methods, GraphDA not only improves classification performance, but also successfully captures graph-structured features more effectively, hence stronger interpretability.",KDD
Variational Inference with Agent-Based Models (Page 854),2016,"In this paper, we develop a variational method to track and make predictions about a real-world system from continuous imperfect observations about this system, using an agent-based model that describes the system dynamics. By combining the power of big data with the power of model-thinking in the stochastic process framework, we can make many valuable predictions.

This method points to a new way to bring together modelers and data miners by turning the real world into a living lab.",AAMAS
Semi-supervised learning with data calibration for long-term time series forecasting,2008,"Many time series prediction methods have focused on single step or short term prediction problems due to the inherent difficulty in controlling the propagation of errors from one prediction step to the next step. Yet, there is a broad range of applications such as climate impact assessments and urban growth planning that require long term forecasting capabilities for strategic decision making. Training an accurate model that produces reliable long term predictions would require an extensive amount of historical data, which are either unavailable or expensive to acquire. For some of these domains, there are alternative ways to generate potential scenarios for the future using computer-driven simulation models, such as global climate and traffic demand models. However, the data generated by these models are currently utilized in a supervised learning setting, where a predictive model trained on past observations is used to estimate the future values. In this paper, we present a semi-supervised learning framework for long-term time series forecasting based on Hidden Markov Model Regression. A covariance alignment method is also developed to deal with the issue of inconsistencies between historical and model simulation data. We evaluated our approach on data sets from a variety of domains, including climate modeling. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the approach compared to other supervised learning methods for long-term time series forecasting.",KDD
Satellite Detection of Moving Vessels in Marine Environments,2019,"There is a growing need for coverage of large maritime areas, mainly in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Due to the difficulty of accessing such large areas, the use of satellite based sensors is the most efficient and cost-effective way to perform this task.

We use real marine traffic data (AIS) to compare their ability to predict vessel behavior in a time frame of between 1Ã¢â¬â24 hours.

A significant fraction of map search traffic is comprised of Ã¢â¬Åaddress queriesÃ¢â¬Â - queries where either the entire query or some terms in it refer to an address or part of an address (road segment, intersection etc.). Here we demonstrate that correctly understanding and tagging address queries are critical for map search engines to fulfill them.

LC-RNN: A Deep Learning Model for Traffic Speed Prediction,2018,"Traffic speed prediction is known as an important but challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel model, called LC-RNN, to achieve more accurate traffic speed prediction than existing solutions. It takes advantage of both RNN and CNN models by a rational integration of them, so as to learn more meaningful time-series patterns that can adapt to the traffic dynamics of surrounding areas. Furthermore, since traffic evolution is restricted by the underlying road network, a network embedded convolution structure is proposed to capture topology aware features. The fusion with other information, including periodicity and context factors, is also considered to further improve accuracy. Extensive experiments on two real datasets demonstrate that our proposed LC-RNN outperforms six well-known existing methods.Ã",IJCAI
PressLight: Learning Max Pressure Control to Coordinate Traffic Signals in Arterial Network,2019,"Traffic signal control is essential for transportation efficiency in road networks. It has been a challenging problem because of the complexity in traffic dynamics. Conventional transportation research suffers from the incompetency to adapt to dynamic traffic situations. Recent studies propose to use reinforcement learning (RL) to search for more efficient traffic signal plans. However, most existing RL-based studies design the key elements - reward and state - in a heuristic way. This results in highly sensitive performances and a long learning process. To avoid the heuristic design of RL elements, we propose to connect RL with recent studies in transportation research. Our method is inspired by the state-of-the-art method max pressure (MP) in the transportation field. The reward design of our method is well supported by the theory in MP, which can be proved to be maximizing the throughput of the traffic network, i.e., minimizing the overall network travel time. We also show that our concise state representation can fully support the optimization of the proposed reward function. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms both conventional transportation approaches and existing learning-based methods.",KDD
Optimal Pricing for Efficient Electric Vehicle Charging Station Management (Page 749),2016,"The rapid development of Electric Vehicles (EVs) seen in recent years has been drawing increasing attentions from the public, markets, decision-makers, and academia. Notwithstanding the progress, issues still remain. Because of the widely complained disadvantages of limited battery capacity and long charging time, charging convenience has become a top concern that greatly hinders the adoption of EVs. Specialized EV charging station, which provides more than 10 times faster charging speed than domestic charging, is therefore a critical element for successful EV promotion. While most existing researches focus on optimizing spatial placement of charging stations, they are inflexible and inefficient against rapidly changing urban structure and traffic pattern. Therefore, this paper approaches the management of EV charging stations from the pricing perspective as a more flexible and adaptive complement to established charging station placement. In this paper, we build a realistic pricing model in consideration of residential travel pattern and {EV} drivers' self-interested charging behavior, traffic congestion, and operating expense of charging stations. We formulate the pricing problem as a mixed integer non-convex optimization problem, and propose a scalable algorithm to solve it.

Traffic Updates: Saying a Lot While Revealing a Little,2019,"Taking speed reports from vehicles is a proven, inexpensive way to infer traffic conditions. However, due to concerns about privacy and bandwidth, not every vehicle occupant may want to transmit data about their location and speed in real time. We show how to drastically reduce the number of transmissions in two ways, both based on a Markov random field for modeling traffic speed and flow. First, we show that a only a small number of vehicles need to report from each location. We give a simple, probabilistic method that lets a group of vehicles decide on which subset will transmit a report, preserving privacy by coordinating without any communication. The second approach computes the potential value of any locationÃ¢â¬â¢s speed report, emphasizing those reports that will most affect the overall speed inferences, and omitting those that contribute little value. Both methods significantly reduce the amount of communication necessary for accurate speed inferences on a road network.",AAAI
Predicting Path Failure In Time-Evolving Graphs,2019,"In this paper we use a time-evolving graph which consists of a sequence of graph snapshots over time to model many real-world networks. We study the path classification problem in a time-evolving graph, which has many applications in real-world scenarios, for example, predicting path failure in a telecommunication network and predicting path congestion in a traffic network in the near future. In order to capture the temporal dependency and graph structure dynamics, we design a novel deep neural network named Long Short-Term Memory R-GCN (LRGCN). LRGCN considers temporal dependency between time-adjacent graph snapshots as a special relation with memory, and uses relational GCN to jointly process both intra-time and inter-time relations. We also propose a new path representation method named self-attentive path embedding (SAPE), to embed paths of arbitrary length into fixed-length vectors. Through experiments on a real-world telecommunication network and a traffic network in California, we demonstrate the superiority of LRGCN to other competing methods in path failure prediction, and prove the effectiveness of SAPE on path representation.",KDD
iCO2: Multi-User Eco-Driving Training Environment Based on Distributed Constraint Optimization (Page 925),2013,"Multi-agent systems have already been successfully applied to a variety of traffic control problems and demonstrated the potential to lower travel times and environmental impact. Sharing this goal, we have developed iCO2, an online tool for training eco-friendly driving in a multi-user three-dimensional environment. iCO2 supports eco-driving practice by instructing computer-controlled agents, such as traffic lights and other vehicles, to create traffic situations that make eco-driving more difficult. Hence the agents take the role of ""opponents"" that try to achieve the optimal challenge level for the skill level of each user. The research challenge is to find the optimal challenge level for all user drivers in a shared simulation space that (1) involves both controllable entities (""opponents"") and non-controllable entities (users) and (2) is highly dynamic, with dependencies between entities being created and destroyed in real time. We try to solve this problem by modeling the scenario as a distributed constraint optimization problem (DCOP). The main contribution of our paper is the application of a DCOP algorithm to such a new type of application scenario. We evaluate our approach by running scenarios both in terms of speed and optimality of the solutions proposed by the DCOP algorithm.",AAMAS
Short and Long-term Pattern Discovery Over Large-Scale Geo-Spatiotemporal Data,2019,"Pattern discovery in geo-spatiotemporal data (such as traffic and weather data) is about finding patterns of collocation, co-occurrence, cascading, or cause and effect between geospatial entities. Using simplistic definitions of spatiotemporal neighborhood (a common characteristic of the existing general-purpose frameworks) is not semantically representative of geo-spatiotemporal data. We therefore introduce a new geo-spatiotemporal pattern discovery framework which defines a semantically correct definition of neighborhood; and then provides two capabilities, one to explore propagation patterns and the other to explore influential patterns. Propagation patterns reveal common cascading forms of geospatial entities in a region. Influential patterns demonstrate the impact of temporally long-term geospatial entities on their neighborhood. We apply this framework on a large dataset of traffic and weather data at countrywide scale, collected for the contiguous United States over two years. Our important findings include the identification of 90 common propagation patterns of traffic and weather entities (e.g., rain --> accident --> congestion), which results in identification of four categories of states within the US; and interesting influential patterns with respect to the ""location"", ""duration"", and ""type"" of long-term entities (e.g., a major construction --> more traffic incidents). These patterns and the categorization of the states provide useful insights on the driving habits and infrastructure characteristics of different regions in the US, and could be of significant value for applications such as urban planning and personalized insurance.",KDD
Deep Sequence Learning with Auxiliary Information for Traffic Prediction,2018,"Predicting traffic conditions from online route queries is a challenging task as there are many complicated interactions over the roads and crowds involved.

We do this within an encoder-decoder sequence learning framework that integrates the following data: 1) offline geographical and social attributes. For example, the geographical structure of roads or public social events such as national celebrations; 2) road intersection information. In general, traffic congestion occurs at major junctions; 3) online crowd queries. For example, when many online queries issued for the same destination due to a public performance, the traffic around the destination will potentially become heavier at this location after a while. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on a real-world dataset from Baidu have demonstrated the effectiveness of our framework.",KDD
Enforcing Liveness in Autonomous Traffic Management,2011,"Looking ahead to the time when autonomous cars will be common, Dresner and Stone proposed a multiagent systems-based intersection control protocol called Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM). They showed that by leveraging the capacities of autonomous vehicles it is possible to dramatically reduce the time wasted in traffic, and therefore also fuel consumption and air pollution. The proposed protocol, however, handles reservation requests one at a time and does not prioritize reservations according to their relative priorities and waiting times, causing potentially large inequalities in granting reservations. For example, at an intersection between a main street and an alley, vehicles from the alley can take an excessively long time to get reservations to enter the intersection, causing a waste of time and fuel. The same is true in a network of intersections, in which gridlock may occur and cause traffic congestion. In this paper, we introduce the batch processing of reservations in AIM to enforce liveness properties in intersections and analyze the conditions under which no vehicle will get stuck in traffic. Our experimental results show that our prioritizing schemes outperform previous intersection control protocols in unbalanced traffic.",AAAI
Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks for Traffic Forecasting,2019,"Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNN) have become an increasingly active field of research. It models the spatial dependencies of nodes in a graph with a pre-defined Laplacian matrix based on node distances. However, in many application scenarios, spatial dependencies change over time, and the use of fixed Laplacian matrix cannot capture the change. To track the spatial dependencies among traffic data, we propose a dynamic spatio-temporal GCNN for accurate traffic forecasting. The core of our deep learning framework is the finding of the change of Laplacian matrix with a dynamic Laplacian matrix estimator. To enable timely learning with a low complexity, we creatively incorporate tensor decomposition into the deep learning framework, where real-time traffic data are decomposed into a global component that is stable and depends on long-term temporal-spatial traffic relationship and a local component that captures the traffic fluctuations. We propose a novel design to estimate the dynamic Laplacian matrix of the graph with above two components based on our theoretical derivation, and introduce our design basis. The forecasting performance is evaluated with two realtime traffic datasets. Experiment results demonstrate that our network can achieve up to 25% accuracy improvement.",AAAI
Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks: A Deep Learning Framework for Traffic Forecasting,2018,"Timely accurate traffic forecast is crucial for urban traffic control and guidance. Due to the high nonlinearity and complexity of traffic flow, traditional methods cannot satisfy the requirements of mid-and-long term prediction tasks and often neglect spatial and temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework, Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (STGCN), to tackle the time series prediction problem in traffic domain. Instead of applying regular convolutional and recurrent units, we formulate the problem on graphs and build the model with complete convolutional structures, which enable much faster training speed with fewer parameters. Experiments show that our model STGCN effectively captures comprehensive spatio-temporal correlations through modeling multi-scale traffic networks and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on various real-world traffic datasets.",IJCAI
Latent Space Model for Road Networks to Predict Time-Varying Traffic,2016,"Real-time traffic prediction from high-fidelity spatiotemporal traffic sensor datasets is an important problem for intelligent transportation systems and sustainability. However, it is challenging due to the complex topological dependencies and high dynamism associated with changing road conditions. In this paper, we propose a Latent Space Model for Road Networks (LSM-RN) to address these challenges holistically. In particular, given a series of road network snapshots, we learn the attributes of vertices in latent spaces which capture both topological and temporal properties. As these latent attributes are time-dependent, they can estimate how traffic patterns form and evolve. In addition, we present an incremental online algorithm which sequentially and adaptively learns the latent attributes from the temporal graph changes. Our framework enables real-time traffic prediction by 1) exploiting real-time sensor readings to adjust/update the existing latent spaces, and 2) training as data arrives and making predictions on-the-fly. By conducting extensive experiments with a large volume of real-world traffic sensor data, we demonstrate the superiority of our framework for real-time traffic prediction on large road networks over competitors as well as baseline graph-based LSM's.",KDD
Time Critic Policy Gradient Methods for Traffic Signal Control in Complex and Congested Scenarios,2019,"Employing an optimal traffic light control policy has the potential of having a positive impact, both economic and environmental, on urban mobility. Reinforcement learning techniques have shown promising results in optimizing control policies for basic intersections and low volume traffic. This paper addresses the traffic light control problem in a complex scenario, such as a signalized roundabout with heavy traffic volumes, with the aim of maximizing throughput and avoiding traffic jams. We formulate the environment with a realistic representation of states and actions and a capacity-based reward. We enforce episode terminal conditions to avoid unwanted states, such as long queues interfering with other junctions in the vehicular network. A time-dependent baseline is proposed to reduce the variance of Policy Gradient updates in the setting of episodic conditions, thus improving the algorithm convergence to an optimal solution. We evaluate the method on real data and highly congested traffic, implementing a signalized simulated roundabout with 11 phases. The proposed method is able to avoid traffic jams and achieves higher performance than traditional time-splitting policies and standard Policy Gradient on average delay and effective capacity, while drastically decreasing the emissions.",KDD
Attention Based Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks for Traffic Flow Forecasting,2019,"Forecasting the traffic flows is a critical issue for researchers and practitioners in the field of transportation. However, it is very challenging since the traffic flows usually show high nonlinearities and complex patterns. Most existing traffic flow prediction methods, lacking abilities of modeling the dynamic spatial-temporal correlations of traffic data, thus cannot yield satisfactory prediction results. In this paper, we propose a novel attention based spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ASTGCN) model to solve traffic flow forecasting problem. ASTGCN mainly consists of three independent components to respectively model three temporal properties of traffic flows, i.e., recent, daily-periodic and weekly-periodic dependencies. More specifically, each component contains two major parts: 1) the spatial-temporal attention mechanism to effectively capture the dynamic spatialtemporal correlations in traffic data; 2) the spatial-temporal convolution which simultaneously employs graph convolutions to capture the spatial patterns and common standard convolutions to describe the temporal features. The output of the three components are weighted fused to generate the final prediction results. Experiments on two real-world datasets from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) demonstrate that the proposed ASTGCN model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.",AAAI
Train Outstable Scheduling as Constraint Satisfaction,2013,"This paper outlines the design of a scheduling algorithm that allocates outstabling locations to railway trains. From time to time railway trains may need to be outstabled to temporary locations, such as stations, sidings, depots, etc., until they are needed for regular operations. This is common for urban rail transit, and especially so for those that do not operate 24 hours. During non-traffic hours (NTH), trains are outstabled to various locations along the rail network so that when operations start again next day, the trains will be nearby their originating station or conveniently located so that they can be put into service whenever needed. However, this is complicated by the fact that engineering works, such as rail testing, installation, regular maintenance, etc. are done during the NTH. Therefore, passenger trains must be outstabled in such a way that they do not interfere with night-time engineering works or the movements of associated engineering trains. Since the engineering works scheduling is done separate to outstabling, this is a mixed-system problem. This paper shows how we modeled this as a constraint-satisfaction problem (CSP) and implemented into an Ã¢â¬ÅOutstabling SystemÃ¢â¬Â (OSS) for the Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway (MTR) using a two-stage search algorithm.",AAAI
Differentially private transit data publication: a case study on the montreal transportation system,2012,"With the wide deployment of smart card automated fare collection (SCAFC) systems, public transit agencies have been benefiting from huge volume of transit data, a kind of sequential data, collected every day. Yet, improper publishing and use of transit data could jeopardize passengers' privacy. In this paper, we present our solution to transit data publication under the rigorous differential privacy model for the SociÃÂ©tÃÂ© de transport de MontrÃÂ©al (STM). We propose an efficient data-dependent yet differentially private transit data sanitization approach based on a hybrid-granularity prefix tree structure. Moreover, as a post-processing step, we make use of the inherent consistency constraints of a prefix tree to conduct constrained inferences, which lead to better utility. Our solution not only applies to general sequential data, but also can be seamlessly extended to trajectory data. To our best knowledge, this is the first paper to introduce a practical solution for publishing large volume of sequential data under differential privacy. We examine data utility in terms of two popular data analysis tasks conducted at the STM, namely count queries and frequent sequential pattern mining. Extensive experiments on real-life STM datasets confirm that our approach maintains high utility and is scalable to large datasets.",KDD
Enabling E-Mobility: Facility Location for Battery Loading Stations,2013,"The short cruising range due to the limited battery supply of current Electric Vehicles (EVs) is one of the main obstacles for a complete transition to E-mobility. Until batteries ofhigher energy storage density have been developed, it is of utmost importance to deliberately plan the locations of new loading stations for best possible coverage. Ideally the network of loading stations should allow driving from anywhere to anywhere (and back) without running out of energy. We show that minimizing the number of necessary loading stations to achieve this goal is NP-hard and even worse, we can rule out polynomial-time constant approximation algorithms. Hence algorithms with better approximation guarantees have to make use of the special structure of road networks (which is not obvious how to do it). On the positive side, we show with instance based lower bounds that our heuris-tic algorithms achieve provably good solutions on real-world problem instances.",AAAI
Placement of Loading Stations for Electric Vehicles: No Detours Necessary!,2014,"Compared to conventional cars, electric vehicles still suffer from a considerably shorter cruising range. Combined with the sparsity of battery loading stations, the complete transition to E-mobility still seems a long way to go. In this paper, we consider the problem of placing as few loading stations as possible such that on any shortest path there are enough to guarantee sufficient energy supply. This means, that EV owners no longer have to plan their trips ahead incorporating loading station locations, and are no longer forced to accept long detours to reach their destinations. We show how to model this problem and introduce heuristics which provide close-to-optimal solutions even in large road networks.",AAAI
Learning Heterogeneous Spatial-Temporal Representation for Bike-Sharing Demand Prediction,2019,"Bike-sharing systems, aiming at meeting the publicÃ¢â¬â¢s need for Ã¢â¬Âlast mileÃ¢â¬Â transportation, are becoming popular in recent years. With an accurate demand prediction model, shared bikes, though with a limited amount, can be effectively utilized whenever and wherever there are travel demands. Despite that some deep learning methods, especially long shortterm memory neural networks (LSTMs), can improve the performance of traditional demand prediction methods only based on temporal representation, such improvement is limited due to a lack of mining complex spatial-temporal relations. To address this issue, we proposed a novel model named STG2Vec to learn the representation from heterogeneous spatial-temporal graph. Specifically, we developed an event-flow serializing method to encode the evolution of dynamic heterogeneous graph into a special language pattern such as word sequence in a corpus. Furthermore, a dynamic attention-based graph embedding model is introduced to obtain an importance-awareness vectorized representation of the event flow. Additionally, together with other multi-source information such as geographical position, historical transition patterns and weather, e.g., the representation learned by STG2Vec can be fed into the LSTMs for temporal modeling. Experimental results from Citi-Bike electronic usage records dataset in New York City have illustrated that the proposed model can achieve competitive prediction performance compared with its variants and other baseline models.",AAAI
Energy-Efficient Automatic Train Driving by Learning Driving Patterns,2018,"Railway is regarded as the most sustainable means of modern transportation. With the fast-growing of fleet size and the railway mileage, the energy consumption of trains is becoming a serious concern globally. The nature of railway offers a unique opportunity to optimize the energy efficiency of locomotives by taking advantage of the undulating terrains along a route. The derivation of an energy-optimal train driving solution, however, proves to be a significant challenge due to the high dimension, nonlinearity, complex constraints, and time-varying characteristic of the problem. An optimized solution can only be attained by considering both the complex environmental conditions of a given route and the inherent characteristics of a locomotive. To tackle the problem, this paper employs a high-order correlation learning method for online generation of the energy optimized train driving solutions. Based on the driving data of experienced human drivers, a hypergraph model is used to learn the optimal embedding from the specified features for the decision of a driving operation. First, we design a feature set capturing the driving status. Next all the training data are formulated as a hypergraph and an inductive learning process is conducted to obtain the embedding matrix. The hypergraph model can be used for real-time generation of driving operation. We also proposed a reinforcement updating scheme, which offers the capability of sustainable enhancement on the hypergraph model in industrial applications. The learned model can be used to determine an optimized driving operation in real-time tested on the Hardware-in-Loop platform. Validation experiments proved that the energy consumption of the proposed solution is around 10% lower than that of average human drivers.",AAAI
Unsupervised clustering of multidimensional distributions using earth mover distance,2011,"Multidimensional distributions are often used in data mining to describe and summarize different features of large datasets. It is natural to look for distinct classes in such datasets by clustering the data. A common approach entails the use of methods like k-means clustering. However, the k-means method inherently relies on the Euclidean metric in the embedded space and does not account for additional topology underlying the distribution.
 In this paper, we propose using Earth Mover Distance (EMD) to compare multidimensional distributions. For a n-bin histogram, the EMD is based on a solution to the transportation problem with time complexity O(n3 log n). To mitigate the high computational cost of EMD, we propose an approximation that reduces the cost to linear time. Given the large size of our dataset a fast approximation is crucial for this application.
 Other notions of distances such as the information theoretic Kullback-Leibler divergence and statistical Ãâ¡2 distance, account only for the correspondence between bins with the same index, and do not use information across bins, and are sensitive to bin size. A cross-bin distance measure like EMD is not affected by binning differences and meaningfully matches the perceptual notion of ""nearness"".
 Our technique is simple, efficient and practical for clustering distributions. We demonstrate the use of EMD on a real-world application of analyzing 411,550 anonymous mobility usage patterns which are defined as distributions over a manifold. EMD allows us to represent inherent relationships in this space, and enables us to successfully cluster even sparse signatures.",KDD
Learning Deep Representation from Big and Heterogeneous Data for Traffic Accident Inference,2016,"With the rapid development of urbanization and public transportation system, the number of traffic accidents have significantly increased globally over the past decades and become a big problem for human society. Facing these possible and unexpected traffic accidents, understanding what causes traffic accident and early alarms for some possible ones will play a critical role on planning effective traffic management. However, due to the lack of supported sensing data, research is very limited on the field of updating traffic accident risk in real-time. Therefore, in this paper, we collect big and heterogeneous data (7 months traffic accident data and 1.6 million users' GPS records) to understand how human mobility will affect traffic accident risk. By mining these data, we develop a deep model of Stack denoise Autoencoder to learn hierarchical feature representation of human mobility. And these features are used for efficient prediction of traffic accident risk level. Once the model has been trained, our model can simulate corresponding traffic accident risk map with given real-time input of human mobility. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our model and suggest that traffic accident risk can be significantly more predictable through human mobility.",AAAI
Multi-task Representation Learning for Travel Time Estimation,2018,"One crucial task in intelligent transportation systems is estimating the duration of a potential trip given the origin location, destination location as well as the departure time. Most existing approaches for travel time estimation assume that the route of the trip is given, which does not hold in real-world applications since the route can be dynamically changed due to traffic conditions, user preferences, etc. As inferring the path from the origin and the destination can be time-consuming and nevertheless error-prone, it is desirable to perform origin-destination travel time estimation, which aims to predict the travel time without online route information. This problem is challenging mainly due to its limited amount of information available and the complicated spatiotemporal dependency. In this paper, we propose a MUlti-task Representation learning model for Arrival Time estimation (MURAT). This model produces meaningful representation that preserves various trip properties in the real-world and at the same time leverages the underlying road network and the spatiotemporal prior knowledge. Further-more, we propose a multi-task learning framework to utilize the path information of historical trips during the training phase which boosts the performance. Experimental results on two large-scale real-world datasets show that the proposed approach achieves clear improvements over state-of-the-art methods",KDD
Tripoles: A New Class of Relationships in Time Series Data,2017,"Mining relationships in time series data is of immense interest to several disciplines such as neuroscience, climate science, and transportation. Traditional approaches for mining relationships focus on discovering pair-wise relationships in the data. In this work, we define a novel relationship pattern involving three interacting time series, which we refer to as a tripole. We show that tripoles capture interesting relationship patterns in the data that are not possible to be captured using traditionally studied pair-wise relationships. We demonstrate the utility of tripoles in multiple real-world datasets from various domains including climate science and neuroscience. In particular, our approach is able to discover tripoles that are statistically significant, reproducible across multiple independent data sets, and lead to novel domain insights.",KDD
Maximizing the Probability of Arriving on Time: A Practical Q-Learning Method,2017,"The stochastic shortest path problem is of crucial importance for the development of sustainable transportation systems. Existing methods based on the probability tail model seek for the path that maximizes the probability of arriving at the destination before a deadline. However, they suffer from low accuracy and/or high computational cost. We design a novel Q-learning method where the converged Q-values have the practical meaning as the actual probabilities of arriving on time so as to improve accuracy. By further adopting dynamic neural networks to learn the value function, our method can scale well to large road networks with arbitrary deadlines. Experimental results on real road networks demonstrate the significant advantages of our method over other counterparts.",AAAI
Using AI Local Search to Improve an OR Optimizer,2012,"One of the key issues for transportation companies is to produce an optimal plan for the work of crew members. Crew planning consists of a sequence of phases, the first two corresponding to planning duties (sequences of trips to be done by crew members from their home base to their home base) and planning rosters (sequences of duties and rest days to be followed by crew members during a certain number of weeks). Both duty and roster planning are subject to a large number of constraints. Duty planning is constrained by intra-duty constraints and roster planning by inter-duty constraints. Since inter-duty constraints relate how duties can be combined into a roster, it is desirable that some of these constraints be transposed into the duty planning phase, as additional constraints, to guarantee that the duties produced in the first phase are ""rosterable'' in the second phase. Both Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Operations Research (OR) have addressed duty planning, but for very large scale problems, OR has been far more successful due to its global vision of the problem. This paper discusses the use of AI local search to improve an OR-based duty planning optimizer that uses additional constraints.",AAAI
Graph-based Semi-Supervised & Active Learning for Edge Flows,2019,"We present a graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) method for learning edge flows defined on a graph. Specifically, given flow measurements on a subset of edges, we want to predict the flows on the remaining edges. To this end, we develop a computational framework that imposes certain constraints on the overall flows, such as (approximate) flow conservation. These constraints render our approach different from classical graph-based SSL for vertex labels, which posits that tightly connected nodes share similar labels and leverages the graph structure accordingly to extrapolate from a few vertex labels to the unlabeled vertices. We derive bounds for our method's reconstruction error and demonstrate its strong performance on synthetic and real-world flow networks from transportation, physical infrastructure, and the Web. Furthermore, we provide two active learning algorithms for selecting informative edges on which to measure flow, which has applications for optimal sensor deployment. The first strategy selects edges to minimize the reconstruction error bound and works well on flows that are approximately divergence-free. The second approach clusters the graph and selects bottleneck edges that cross cluster-boundaries, which works well on flows with global trends.",KDD
Scalable Global Alignment Graph Kernel Using Random Features: From Node Embedding to Graph Embedding,2019,"Graph kernels are widely used for measuring the similarity between graphs. Many existing graph kernels, which focus on local patterns within graphs rather than their global properties, suffer from significant structure information loss when representing graphs. Some recent global graph kernels, which utilizes the alignment of geometric node embeddings of graphs, yield state-of-the-art performance. However, these graph kernels are not necessarily positive-definite. More importantly, computing the graph kernel matrix will have at least quadratic time complexity in terms of the number and the size of the graphs. In this paper, we propose a new family of global alignment graph kernels, which take into account the global properties of graphs by using geometric node embeddings and an associated node transportation based on earth mover's distance. Compared to existing global kernels, the proposed kernel is positive-definite. Our graph kernel is obtained by defining a distribution over random graphs, which can naturally yield random feature approximations. The random feature approximations lead to our graph embeddings, which is named as ""random graph embeddings"" (RGE). In particular, RGE is shown to achieve (quasi-)linear scalability with respect to the number and the size of the graphs. The experimental results on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that RGE outperforms or matches twelve state-of-the-art graph classification algorithms.",KDD
Network Connectivity Optimization: Fundamental Limits and Effective Algorithms,2018,"Network connectivity optimization, which aims to manipulate network connectivity by changing its underlying topology, is a fundamental task behind a wealth of high-impact data mining applications, ranging from immunization, critical infrastructure construction, social collaboration mining, bioinformatics analysis, to intelligent transportation system design. To tackle its exponential computation complexity, greedy algorithms have been extensively used for network connectivity optimization by exploiting its diminishing returns property. Despite the empirical success, two key challenges largely remain open. First, on the theoretic side, the hardness, as well as the approximability of the general network connectivity optimization problem are still nascent except for a few special instances. Second, on the algorithmic side, current algorithms are often hard to balance between the optimization quality and the computational efficiency. In this paper, we systematically address these two challenges for the network connectivity optimization problem. First, we reveal some fundamental limits by proving that, for a wide range of network connectivity optimization problems, (1) they are NP-hard and (2) (1-1/e) is the optimal approximation ratio for any polynomial algorithms. Second, we propose an effective, scalable and general algorithm (CONTAIN) to carefully balance the optimization quality and the computational efficiency.",KDD
A Quasi-experimental Estimate of the Impact of P2P Transportation Platforms on Urban Consumer Patterns,2017,"With the pervasiveness of mobile technology and location-based computing, new forms of smart urban transportation, such as Uber & Lyft, have become increasingly popular.

To gain insights about future impact of urban transportation changes, in this paper, we utilize a novel dataset and econometric analysis methods to present a quasi-experimental examination of how the emerging growth of peer-to-peer car sharing services may have affected local consumer mobility and consumption patterns.",KDD
Real-Time Predictive Optimization for Energy Management in a Hybrid Electric Vehicle,2015,"With increasing numbers of electric and hybrid vehicles on the road, transportation presents a unique opportunity to leverage data-driven intelligence to realize large scale impact in energy use and emissions. Energy management in these vehicles is highly sensitive to upcoming power load on the vehicle, which is not considered in conventional reactive policies calculated at design time. Advancements in cheap sensing and computation have enabled on-board upcoming load predictions which can be used to optimize energy management. In this work, we propose and evaluate a novel, real-time optimization strategy that leverages predictions from prior data in a simulated hybrid battery-supercapacitor energy management task. We demonstrate a complete adaptive system that improves over the lifetime of the vehicle as more data is collected and prediction accuracy improves. Using thousands of miles of real-world data collected from both petrol and electric vehicles, we evaluate the performance of our optimization strategy with respect to our cost function. The system achieves performance within 10% of the optimal upper bound calculated using a priori knowledge of the upcoming loads. This performance implies improved battery thermal stability, efficiency, and longevity. Our strategy can be applied to optimize energy use in gas-electric hybrids, battery cooling in electric vehicles, and many other load-sensitive tasks in transportation.",AAAI
An energy-efficient mobile recommender system,2010,"The increasing availability of large-scale location traces creates unprecedent opportunities to change the paradigm for knowledge discovery in transportation systems. A particularly promising area is to extract energy-efficient transportation patterns (green knowledge), which can be used as guidance for reducing inefficiencies in energy consumption of transportation sectors. However, extracting green knowledge from location traces is not a trivial task. Conventional data analysis tools are usually not customized for handling the massive quantity, complex, dynamic, and distributed nature of location traces. To that end, in this paper, we provide a focused study of extracting energy-efficient transportation patterns from location traces. Specifically, we have the initial focus on a sequence of mobile recommendations. As a case study, we develop a mobile recommender system which has the ability in recommending a sequence of pick-up points for taxi drivers or a sequence of potential parking positions. The goal of this mobile recommendation system is to maximize the probability of business success. Along this line, we provide a Potential Travel Distance (PTD) function for evaluating each candidate sequence. This PTD function possesses a monotone property which can be used to effectively prune the search space. Based on this PTD function, we develop two algorithms, LCP and SkyRoute, for finding the recommended routes. Finally, experimental results show that the proposed system can provide effective mobile sequential recommendation and the knowledge extracted from location traces can be used for coaching drivers and leading to the efficient use of energy.",KDD
Joint Representation Learning for Multi-Modal Transportation Recommendation,2019,"Multi-modal transportation recommendation has a goal of recommending a travel plan which considers various transportation modes, such as walking, cycling, automobile, and public transit, and how to connect among these modes. The successful development of multi-modal transportation recommendation systems can help to satisfy the diversified needs of travelers and improve the efficiency of transport networks. However, existing transport recommender systems mainly focus on unimodal transport planning. To this end, in this paper, we propose a joint representation learning framework for multi-modal transportation recommendation based on a carefully-constructed multi-modal transportation graph. Specifically, we first extract a multi-modal transportation graph from large-scale map query data to describe the concurrency of users, Origin-Destination (OD) pairs, and transport modes. Then, we provide effective solutions for the optimization problem and develop an anchor embedding for transport modes to initialize the embeddings of transport modes. Moreover, we infer user relevance and OD pair relevance, and incorporate them to regularize the representation learning. Finally, we exploit the learned representations for online multimodal transportation recommendations. Indeed, our method has been deployed into one of the largest navigation Apps to serve hundreds of millions of users, and extensive experimental results with real-world map query data demonstrate the enhanced performance of the proposed method for multimodal transportation recommendations.",AAAI
DeepTravel: a Neural Network Based Travel Time Estimation Model with Auxiliary Supervision,2018,"Estimating the travel time of a path is of great importance to smart urban mobility. Existing approaches are either based on estimating the time cost of each road segment which are not able to capture many cross-segment complex factors, or designed heuristically in a non-learning-based way which fail to leverage the natural abundant temporal labels of the data, i.e., the time stamp of each trajectory point. In this paper, we leverage on new development of deep neural networks and propose a novel auxiliary supervision model, namely DeepTravel, that can automatically and effectively extract different features, as well as make full use of the temporal labels of the trajectory data. We have conducted comprehensive experiments on real datasets to demonstrate the out-performance of DeepTravel over existing approaches.Ã",IJCAI
Adaptive collective routing using gaussian process dynamic congestion models,2013,"We consider the problem of adaptively routing a fleet of cooperative vehicles within a road network in the presence of uncertain and dynamic congestion conditions. To tackle this problem, we first propose a Gaussian Process Dynamic Congestion Model that can effectively characterize both the dynamics and the uncertainty of congestion conditions. Our model is efficient and thus facilitates real-time adaptive routing in the face of uncertainty. Using this congestion model, we develop an efficient algorithm for non-myopic adaptive routing to minimize the collective travel time of all vehicles in the system. A key property of our approach is the ability to efficiently reason about the long-term value of exploration, which enables collectively balancing the exploration/exploitation trade-off for entire fleets of vehicles. We validate our approach based on traffic data from two large Asian cities. We show that our congestion model is effective in modeling dynamic congestion conditions. We also show that our routing algorithm generates significantly faster routes compared to standard baselines, and achieves near-optimal performance compared to an omniscient routing algorithm. We also present the results from a preliminary field study, which showcases the efficacy of our approach.",KDD
When is a Network a Network?: Multi-Order Graphical Model Selection in Pathways and Temporal Networks,2017,"We introduce a framework for the modeling of sequential data capturing pathways of varying lengths observed in a network. Such data are important, e.g., when studying click streams in the Web, travel patterns in transportation systems, information cascades in social networks, biological pathways, or time-stamped social interactions. While it is common to apply graph analytics and network analysis to such data, recent works have shown that temporal correlations can invalidate the results of such methods. This raises a fundamental question: When is a network abstraction of sequential data justified?Addressing this open question, we propose a framework that combines Markov chains of multiple, higher orders into a multi-layer graphical model that captures temporal correlations in pathways at multiple length scales simultaneously. We develop a model selection technique to infer the optimal number of layers of such a model and show that it outperforms baseline Markov order detection techniques. An application to eight real-world data sets on pathways and temporal networks shows that it allows to infer graphical models that capture both topological and temporal characteristics of such data. Our work highlights fallacies of network abstractions and provides a principled answer to the open question when they are justified. Generalizing network representations to multi-order graphical models, it opens perspectives for new data mining and knowledge discovery algorithms.",KDD
Deep Choice Model Using Pointer Networks for Airline Itinerary Prediction,2017,"Travel providers such as airlines and on-line travel agents are becoming more and more interested in understanding how passengers choose among alternative itineraries when searching for flights. This knowledge helps them better display and adapt their offer, taking into account market conditions and customer needs. Some common applications are not only filtering and sorting alternatives, but also changing certain attributes in real-time (e.g., changing the price). In this paper, we concentrate with the problem of modeling air passenger choices of flight itineraries. This problem has historically been tackled using classical Discrete Choice Modelling techniques. Traditional statistical approaches, in particular the Multinomial Logit model (MNL), is widely used in industrial applications due to its simplicity and general good performance. However, MNL models present several shortcomings and assumptions that might not hold in real applications. To overcome these difficulties, we present a new choice model based on Pointer Networks. Given an input sequence, this type of deep neural architecture combines Recurrent Neural Networks with the Attention Mechanism to learn the conditional probability of an output whose values correspond to positions in an input sequence. Therefore, given a sequence of different alternatives presented to a customer, the model can learn to point to the one most likely to be chosen by the customer. The proposed method was evaluated on a real dataset that combines on-line user search logs and airline flight bookings. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the traditional MNL model on several metrics.",KDD
Optimizing Limousine Service with AI,2010,"A common problem faced by expanding companies is the lack of skilled and experienced domain experts, especially planners and controllers. This can seriously slow down or impede growth. This paper describes how we worked with one of the largest travel agencies in Hong Kong to alleviate this problem by using AI to support decision-making and problem-solving so that their planners/controllers can be more productive in sustaining business growth while providing quality service. This paper describes a Web-based mission critical Fleet Management System (FMS) that supports the scheduling and management of a fleet of luxury limousines. Clientele is mainly business travelers. The use of AI allowed our client to increase their business volume and expand fleet size with the same team of planners/controllers while maintaining service quality. This paper also describes our experience in building modern AI systems leveraging on Web 2.0 open-source tools and libraries.

Geo-SAGE: A Geographical Sparse Additive Generative Model for Spatial Item Recommendation,2015,"With the rapid development of location-based social networks (LBSNs), spatial item recommendation has become an important means to help people discover attractive and interesting venues and events, especially when users travel out of town. However, this recommendation is very challenging compared to the traditional recommender systems. A user can visit only a limited number of spatial items, leading to a very sparse user-item matrix. Most of the items visited by a user are located within a short distance from where he/she lives, which makes it hard to recommend items when the user travels to a far away place. Moreover, user interests and behavior patterns may vary dramatically across different geographical regions. In light of this, we propose Geo-SAGE, a geographical sparse additive generative model for spatial item recommendation in this paper. Geo-SAGE considers both user personal interests and the preference of the crowd in the target region, by exploiting both the co-occurrence pattern of spatial items and the content of spatial items. To further alleviate the data sparsity issue, Geo-SAGE exploits the geographical correlation by smoothing the crowd's preferences over a well-designed spatial index structure called spatial pyramid. We conduct extensive experiments and the experimental results clearly demonstrate our Geo-SAGE model outperforms the state-of-the-art.",KDD
A global constrained optimization method for designing road networks with small diameters,2013,"The road network design problem is to optimize the road network by selecting paths to improve or adding paths in the existing road network, under certain constraints, e.g., the weighted sum of modifying costs. Since its multi-objective nature, the road network design problem is often challenging for designers. Empirically, the smaller diameter a road network has, the more connected and efficient the road network is. Based on this observation, we propose a set of constrained convex models for designing road networks with small diameters. To be specific, we theoretically prove that the diameter of the road network, which is evaluated w.r.t the travel times in the network, can be bounded by the algebraic connectivity in spectral graph theory since that the upper and lower bounds of diameter are inversely proportional to algebraic connectivity. Then we can focus on increasing the algebraic connectivity instead of reducing the network diameter, under the budget constraints. The above formulation leads to a semi-definite program, in which we can get its global solution easily. Then, we present some simulation experiments to show the correctness of our method. At last, we compare our method with an existing method based on the genetic algorithm.",IJCAI
Named Entity Recognition in Travel-Related Search Queries,2015,"This paper addresses the problem of named entity recognition (NER) in travel-related search queries. NER is an important step toward a richer understanding of user-generated inputs in information retrieval systems. NER in queries is challenging due to minimal context and few structural clues. NER in restricted-domain queries is useful in vertical search applications, for example following query classification in general search. This paper describes an efficient machine learning-based solution for the high-quality extraction of semantic entities from query inputs in a restricted-domain information retrieval setting. We apply a conditional random field (CRF) sequence model to travel-domain search queries and achieve high-accuracy results. Our approach yields an overall F1 score of 86.4% on a held-out test set, outperforming a baseline score of 82.0% on a CRF with standard features. The resulting NER classifier is currently in use in a real-life travel search engine.",AAAI
Effective and Efficient Reuse of Past Travel Behavior for Route Recommendation,2019,"With the increasing availability of moving-object tracking data, use of this data for route search and recommendation is increasingly important. To this end, we propose a novel parallel split-and-combine approach to enable route search by locations (RSL-Psc). Given a set of routes, a set of places to visit O, and a threshold ÃÂ¸, we retrieve the route composed of sub-routes that (i) has similarity to O no less than ÃÂ¸ and (ii) contains the minimum number of sub-route combinations. The resulting functionality targets a broad range of applications, including route planning and recommendation, ridesharing, and location-based services in general. To enable efficient and effective RSL-Psc computation on massive route data, we develop novel search space pruning techniques and enable use of the parallel processing capabilities of modern processors. Specifically, we develop two parallel algorithms, Fully-Split Parallel Search (FSPS) and Group-Split Parallel Search (GSPS). We divide the route split-and-combine task into Ã¢Ëâk=0 M S(|O|,k+1) sub-tasks, where M is the maximum number of combinations and S(Ã¢â¹â¦) is the Stirling number of the second kind. In each sub-task, we use network expansion and exploit spatial similarity bounds for pruning. The algorithms split candidate routes into sub-routes and combine them to construct new routes. The sub-tasks are independent and are performed in parallel. Extensive experiments with real data offer insight into the performance of the algorithms, indicating that our RSL-Psc problem can generate high-quality results and that the two algorithms are capable of achieving high efficiency and scalability.",KDD
A Location-Sentiment-Aware Recommender System for Both Home-Town and Out-of-Town Users,2017,"Spatial item recommendation has become an important means to help people discover interesting locations, especially when people pay a visit to unfamiliar regions. Some current researches are focusing on modelling individual and collective geographical preferences for spatial item recommendation based on users' check-in records, but they fail to explore the phenomenon of user interest drift across geographical regions, i.e., users would show different interests when they travel to different regions. Besides, they ignore the influence of public comments for subsequent users' check-in behaviors. Specifically, it is intuitive that users would refuse to check in to a spatial item whose historical reviews seem negative overall, even though it might fit their interests. Therefore, it is necessary to recommend the right item to the right user at the right location. In this paper, we propose a latent probabilistic generative model called LSARS to mimic the decision-making process of users' check-in activities both in home-town and out-of-town scenarios by adapting to user interest drift and crowd sentiments, which can learn location-aware and sentiment-aware individual interests from the contents of spatial items and user reviews. Due to the sparsity of user activities in out-of-town regions, LSARS is further designed to incorporate the public preferences learned from local users' check-in behaviors. Finally, we deploy LSARS into two practical application scenes: spatial item recommendation and target user discovery. Extensive experiments on two large-scale location-based social networks (LBSNs) datasets show that LSARS achieves better performance than existing state-of-the-art methods.",KDD
Discovering Valuable items from Massive Data,2015,"Suppose there is a large collection of items, each with an associated cost and an inherent utility that is revealed only once we commit to selecting it. Given a budget on the cumulative cost of the selected items, how can we pick a subset of maximal value? This task generalizes several important problems such as multi-arm bandits, active search and the knapsack problem. We present an algorithm, GP-SELECT, which utilizes prior knowledge about similarity between items, expressed as a kernel function. GP-SELECT uses Gaussian process prediction to balance exploration (estimating the unknown value of items) and exploitation (selecting items of high value). We extend GP-SELECT to be able to discover sets that simultaneously have high utility and are diverse. Our preference for diversity can be specified as an arbitrary monotone submodular function that quantifies the diminishing returns obtained when selecting similar items. Furthermore, we exploit the structure of the model updates to achieve an order of magnitude (up to 40X) speedup in our experiments without resorting to approximations. We provide strong guarantees on the performance of GP-SELECT and apply it to three real-world case studies of industrial relevance: (1) Refreshing a repository of prices in a Global Distribution System for the travel industry, (2) Identifying diverse, binding-affine peptides in a vaccine design task and (3) Maximizing clicks in a web-scale recommender system by recommending items to users.",KDD
Leveraging collaborative tagging for web item design,2011,"The popularity of collaborative tagging sites has created new challenges and opportunities for designers of web items, such as electronics products, travel itineraries, popular blogs, etc. An increasing number of people are turning to online reviews and user-specified tags to choose from among competing items. This creates an opportunity for designers to build items that are likely to attract desirable tags when published. In this paper, we consider a novel optimization problem: given a training dataset of existing items with their user-submitted tags, and a query set of desirable tags, design the k best new items expected to attract the maximum number of desirable tags. We show that this problem is NP-Complete, even if simple Naive Bayes Classifiers are used for tag prediction. We present two principled algorithms for solving this problem: (a) an exact ""two-tier"" algorithm (based on top-k querying techniques), which performs much better than the naive brute-force algorithm and works well for moderate problem instances, and (b) a novel polynomial-time approximation algorithm with provable error bound for larger problem instances. We conduct detailed experiments on synthetic and real data crawled from the web to evaluate the efficiency and quality of our proposed algorithms.",KDD
Meme-tracking and the dynamics of the news cycle,2009,"Tracking new topics, ideas, and ""memes"" across the Web has been an issue of considerable interest. Recent work has developed methods for tracking topic shifts over long time scales, as well as abrupt spikes in the appearance of particular named entities. However, these approaches are less well suited to the identification of content that spreads widely and then fades over time scales on the order of days - the time scale at which we perceive news and events.
 We develop a framework for tracking short, distinctive phrases that travel relatively intact through on-line text; developing scalable algorithms for clustering textual variants of such phrases, we identify a broad class of memes that exhibit wide spread and rich variation on a daily basis. As our principal domain of study, we show how such a meme-tracking approach can provide a coherent representation of the news cycle - the daily rhythms in the news media that have long been the subject of qualitative interpretation but have never been captured accurately enough to permit actual quantitative analysis. We tracked 1.6 million mainstream media sites and blogs over a period of three months with the total of 90 million articles and we find a set of novel and persistent temporal patterns in the news cycle. In particular, we observe a typical lag of 2.5 hours between the peaks of attention to a phrase in the news media and in blogs respectively, with divergent behavior around the overall peak and a ""heartbeat""-like pattern in the handoff between news and blogs. We also develop and analyze a mathematical model for the kinds of temporal variation that the system exhibits.",KDD
Cost-aware travel tour recommendation,2011,"Advances in tourism economics have enabled us to collect massive amounts of travel tour data. If properly analyzed, this data can be a source of rich intelligence for providing real-time decision making and for the provision of travel tour recommendations. However, tour recommendation is quite different from traditional recommendations, because the tourist's choice is directly affected by the travel cost, which includes the financial cost and the time. To that end, in this paper, we provide a focused study of cost-aware tour recommendation. Along this line, we develop two cost-aware latent factor models to recommend travel packages by considering both the travel cost and the tourist's interests. Specifically, we first design a cPMF model, which models the tourist's cost with a 2-dimensional vector. Also, in this cPMF model, the tourist's interests and the travel cost are learnt by exploring travel tour data. Furthermore, in order to model the uncertainty in the travel cost, we further introduce a Gaussian prior into the cPMF model and develop the GcPMF model, where the Gaussian prior is used to express the uncertainty of the travel cost. Finally, experiments on real-world travel tour data show that the cost-aware recommendation models outperform state-of-the-art latent factor models with a significant margin. Also, the GcPMF model with the Gaussian prior can better capture the impact of the uncertainty of the travel cost, and thus performs better than the cPMF model.",KDD
Three-Dimensional Stable Matching Problem for Spatial Crowdsourcing Platforms,2019,"The popularity of mobile Internet techniques and Online-To-Offline(O2O) business models has led to the emergence of various spatial crowdsourcing (SC) platforms in our daily life. A core issue of SC platforms is to assign tasks to suitable crowd workers. Existing approaches usually focus on the matching of two types of objects,tasks and workers, and let workers to travel to the location of usersto provide services, which is a 2D matching problem. However, recent services provided by some new platforms, such as person-alized haircut service1and station ride-sharing, need users andworkers travel together to a third workplace to complete the service, which is indeed a 3D matching problem. Approaches in the existingstudies either cannot solve such 3D matching problem, or lack aassignment plan satisfying both users' and workers' preference inreal applications. Thus, in this paper, we propose a 3-Dimensional Stable Spatial Matching(3D-SSM) for the 3D matching problem innew SC services. We prove that the 3D-SSM problem is NP-hard, and propose two baseline algorithms and two efficient approximatealgorithms with bounded approximate ratios to solve it. Finally, weconduct extensive experiment studies which verify the efficiencyand effectiveness of the proposed algorithms on real and synthetic datasets.",KDD
Dynamic Pricing for Airline Ancillaries with Customer Context,2019,"Ancillaries have become a major source of revenue and profitability in the travel industry. Yet, conventional pricing strategies are based on business rules that are poorly optimized and do not respond to changing market conditions. This paper describes the dynamic pricing model developed by Deepair solutions, an AI technology provider for travel suppliers. We present a pricing model that provides dynamic pricing recommendations specific to each customer interaction and optimizes expected revenue per customer. The unique nature of personalized pricing provides the opportunity to search over the market space to find the optimal price-point of each ancillary for each customer, without violating customer privacy.
 In this paper, we present and compare three approaches for dynamic pricing of ancillaries, with increasing levels of sophistication: (1) a two-stage forecasting and optimization model using a logistic mapping function; (2) a two-stage model that uses a deep neural network for forecasting, coupled with a revenue maximization technique using discrete exhaustive search; (3) a single-stage end-to-end deep neural network that recommends the optimal price. We describe the performance of these models based on both offline and online evaluations. We also measure the real-world business impact of these approaches by deploying them in an A/B test on an airline's internet booking website. We show that traditional machine learning techniques outperform human rule-based approaches in an online setting by improving conversion by 36% and revenue per offer by 10%. We also provide results for our offline experiments which show that deep learning algorithms outperform traditional machine learning techniques for this problem. Our end-to-end deep learning model is currently being deployed by the airline in their booking system.",KDD
Predicting Vehicular Travel Times by Modeling Heterogeneous Influences Between Arterial Roads,2018,"Predicting travel times of vehicles in urban settings is a useful and tangible quantity of interest in the context of intelligent transportation systems. We address the problem of travel time prediction in arterial roads using data sampled from probe vehicles. There is only a limited literature on methods using data input from probe vehicles. The spatio-temporal dependencies captured by existing data driven approaches are either too detailed or very simplistic. We strike a balance of the existing data driven approaches to account for varying degrees of influence a given road may experience from its neighbors, while controlling the number of parameters to be learnt. Specifically, we use a NoisyOR conditional probability distribution (CPD) in conjunction with a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) to model state transitions of various roads. We propose an efficient algorithm to learn model parameters. We also propose an algorithm for predicting travel times on trips of arbitrary durations. Using synthetic and real world data traces we demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method under different traffic conditions.",AAAI
Learning to Estimate the Travel Time,2018,"Vehicle travel time estimation or estimated time of arrival (ETA) is one of the most important location-based services (LBS). It is becoming increasingly important and has been widely used as a basic service in navigation systems and intelligent transportation systems. This paper presents a novel machine learning solution to predict the vehicle travel time based on floating-car data. First, we formulate ETA as a pure spatial-temporal regression problem based on a large set of effective features. Second, we adapt different existing machine learning models to solve the regression problem. Furthermore, we propose a Wide-Deep-Recurrent (WDR) learning model to accurately predict the travel time along a given route at a given departure time. We then jointly train wide linear models, deep neural networks and recurrent neural networks together to take full advantages of all three models. We evaluate our solution offline with millions of historical vehicle travel data. We also deploy the proposed solution on Didi Chuxing's platform, which services billions of ETA requests and benefits millions of customers per day. Our extensive evaluations show that our proposed deep learning algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art learning algorithms, as well as the solutions provided by leading industry LBS providers.",KDD
Data-Driven Approximations to NP-Hard Problems,2017,"There exist a number of problem classes for which obtaining the exact solution becomes exponentially expensive with increasing problem size. The quadratic assignment problem (QAP) or the travelling salesman problem (TSP) are just two examples of such NP-hard problems. In practice, approximate algorithms are employed to obtain a suboptimal solution, where one must face a trade-off between computational complexity and solution quality. In this paper, we propose to learn to solve these problem from approximate examples, using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Surprisingly, such architectures are capable of producing highly accurate solutions at minimal computational cost. Moreover, we introduce a simple, yet effective technique for improving the initial (weak) training set by incorporating the objective cost into the training procedure. We demonstrate the functionality of our approach on three exemplar applications: marginal distributions of a joint matching space, feature point matching and the travelling salesman problem. We show encouraging results on synthetic and real data in all three cases.",AAAI
A Schedule Optimization Tool for Destructive and Non-Destructive Vehicle Tests,2014,"Whenever an auto manufacturer refreshes an existing car or truck model or builds a new one, the model will undergo hundreds if not thousands of tests before the factory line and tooling is finished and vehicle production beings. These tests are generally carried out on expensive, custom-made vehicles because the new factory lines for the model do not exist yet. The work presented in this paper describes how an existing intelligent scheduling software framework was modified to include domain-specific heuristics used in the vehicle test planning process. The result of this work is a prototype scheduling tool that optimizes the overall given test schedule in order to complete the work in a given time window while minimizing the total number of vehicles required for the test schedule. Initial results are presented that show a reduction in required test vehicles compared to manual scheduling of the same tasks as well as increased capability to ask Ã¢â¬Åwhat-ifÃ¢â¬Â questions to further improve the schedule.",AAAI
"Dispatch with Confidence: Integration of Machine Learning, Optimization and Simulation for Open Pit Mines",2017,"Open pit mining operations require utilization of extremely expensive equipment such as large trucks, shovels and loaders. To remain competitive, mining companies are under pressure to increase equipment utilization and reduce operational costs. The key to this in mining operations is to have sophisticated truck assignment strategies which will ensure that equipment is utilized efficiently with minimum operating cost. To address this problem, we have implemented truck assignment approach which integrates machine learning, linear/integer programming and simulation. Our truck assignment approach takes into consideration the number of trucks and their sizes, shovels and dump locations as well as stochastic activity times during the operations. Machine learning is used to predict probability distributions of equipment activity duration. We have validated the approach using data collected from two open pit mines. Our experimental results show that our approach offers increase of 10% in efficiency. Presented results demonstrate that machine learning can bring significant value to mining industry.",KDD
A Multiagent Approach to Variable-Rate Electric Vehicle Charging Coordination (Page 1131),2015,"We present a coordination mechanism for variable-rate electric vehicle (EV) charging that combines the benefits of a decentralized decision making approach with a top-down control mechanism based on price functions. This combination allows independent decisions by self-interested EV agents, while ensuring that aggregate power demand from EV charging converges to a desired profile as determined by a control agent. This profile can yield reduced demand volatility, or a better match between the output of renewable energy sources and overall demand. We observe that price signals from the control agent are sufficient to motivate self-interested EV agents to adjust charging rate and produce the desired profile, even given a range of individual user preferences. We show that our hybrid coordination mechanism prevents herding in EV charging, which is typical in populations where all agents receive the same price signals and make similar charging decisions. Specifically, the control agent learns the responses of the EV agents in order to adjust its price signals, and eventually converges to coordinated charging, thereby producing the desired demand profile. We compare our approach with various benchmarks and show that EV charging congestion (herding) is reduced, while peaks and volatility of demand are mitigated.",AAMAS
Ontology Re-Engineering: A Case Study from the Automotive Industry,2016,"For over twenty five years Ford has been utilizing an AI-based system to manage process planning for vehicle assembly at our assembly plants around the world.

The knowledge about FordÃ¢â¬â¢s manufacturing processes is contained in an ontology originally developed using the KL-ONE representation language and methodology. To preserve the viability of the GSPAS ontology and to make it easily usable for other applications within Ford, we needed to re-engineer and convert the KL-ONE ontology into a semantic web OWL/RDF format.

Achieving Stable and Fair Profit Allocation with Minimum Subsidy in Collaborative Logistics,2016,"With the advent of e-commerce, logistics providers are faced with the challenge of handling fluctuating and sparsely distributed demand, which raises their operational costs significantly. As a result, horizontal cooperation are gaining momentum around the world. One of the major impediments, however, is the lack of stable and fair profit sharing mechanism. In this paper, we address this problem using the framework of computational cooperative games. We first present cooperative vehicle routing game as a model for collaborative logistics operations. Using the axioms of Shapley value as the conditions for fairness, we show that a stable, fair and budget balanced allocation does not exist in many instances of the game. By relaxing budget balance, we then propose an allocation scheme based on the normalized Shapley value. We show that this scheme maintains stability and fairness while requiring minimum subsidy. Finally, using numerical experiments we demonstrate the feasibility of the scheme under various settings.",AAAI
A Data-Driven Three-Layer Algorithm for Split Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem with 3D Container Loading Constraint,2018,"Split Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem with 3D Loading Constraints (3L-SDVRP) can be seen as the most important problem in large-scale manufacturing logistics. The goal is to devise a strategy consisting of three NP-hard planning components: vehicle routing, cargo splitting and container loading, which shall be jointly optimized for cost savings. The problem is an enhanced variant of the classical logistics problem 3L-CVRP, and its complexity leaps beyond current studies of solvability. Our solution employs a novel data-driven three-layer search algorithm (DTSA), which we designed to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of traditional meta-heuristic approaches, through learning from data and from simulation.
 A detailed experimental evaluation on real data shows our algorithm is versatile in solving this practical complex constrained multi-objective optimization problem, and our framework may be of general interest. DTSA performs much better than the state-of-the-art algorithms both in efficiency and optimization performance. Our algorithm has been deployed in the UAT (User Acceptance Test) environment; conservative estimates suggest that the full usage of our algorithm would save millions of dollars in logistics costs per year, besides savings due to automation and more efficient routing.",KDD
Demand-Aware Charger Planning for Electric Vehicle Sharing,2018,"Cars of the future have been predicted as shared and electric. There has been a rapid growth in electric vehicle (EV) sharing services worldwide in recent years. For EV-sharing platforms to excel, it is essential for them to offer private charging infrastructure for exclusive use that meets the charging demand of their clients. Particularly, they need to plan not only the places to build charging stations, but also the amounts of chargers per station, to maximally satisfy the requirements on global charging coverage and local charging demand. Existing research efforts are either inapplicable for their different problem formulations or are at a coarse granularity. In this paper, we formulate the \underlineE lectric \underlineV ehicle \underlineC harger \underlineP lanning (EVCP) problem especially for EV-sharing. We prove that the \shortpro problem is NP-hard, and design an approximation algorithm to solve the problem with a theoretical bound of $1-\frac1 e $.

Learning Driver's Behavior to Improve the Acceptance of Adaptive Cruise Control,2012,"Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) is a technology that allows a vehicle to automatically adjust its speed to maintain a preset distance from the vehicle in front of it based on the driver's preferences. Individual drivers have different driving styles and preferences. Current systems do not distinguish among the users. We introduce a method to combine machine learning algorithms with demographic information and expert advice into existing automated assistive systems. This method can save on the interactions between drivers and automated systems by adjusting parameters relevant to the operation of these systems based on their specific drivers and context of drive. We also learn when users tend to engage and disengage the automated system. This method sheds light on the kinds of dynamics that users develop while interacting with automation and can teach us how to improve these systems for the benefit of their users. While accepted packages such as Weka were successful in learning drivers' behavior, we found that improved learning models could be developed by adding information on drivers' demographics and a previously developed model about different driver types. We present the general methodology of our learning procedure and suggest applications of our approach to other domains as well.",AAAI
Optimizing a Start-Stop Controller Using Policy Search,2014,"We applied a policy search algorithm to the problem of optimizing a start-stop controller Ã¢â¬â a controller used in a car to turn off the vehicle's engine, and thus save energy, when the vehicle comes to a temporary halt. We were able to improve the existing policy by approximately 12% using real driver trace data. We also experimented with using multiple policies, and found that doing so could lead to a further 8% improvement if we could determine which policy to apply at each stop. The driver's behaviors before stopping were found to be uncorrelated with the policy that performed best; however, further experimentation showed that the driver's behavior during the stop may be more useful, suggesting a useful direction for adding complexity to the underlying start-stop policy.",AAAI

Improving Hybrid Vehicle Fuel Efficiency Using Inverse Reinforcement Learning,2012,"Deciding what mix of engine and battery power to use is critical to hybrid vehicles' fuel efficiency. Current solutions consider several factors such as the charge of the battery and how efficient the engine operates at a given speed. Previous research has shown that by taking into account the future power requirements of the vehicle, a more efficient balance of engine vs. battery power can be attained. In this paper, we utilize a probabilistic driving route prediction system, trained using Inverse Reinforcement Learning, to optimize the hybrid control policy. Our approach considers routes that the driver is likely to be taking, computing an optimal mix of engine and battery power. This approach has the potential to increase vehicle power efficiency while not requiring any hardware modification or change in driver behavior.

Abstract Routing Models and Abstractions in the Context of Vehicle Routing,2015,"The functional and the algebraic routing problem are generalizations of the shortest path problem. This paper shows that both problems are equivalent with respect to the concept of profile searches known from time-dependent routing. Because of this, it is possible to apply various shortest path algorithms to these routing problems. This is demonstrated using contraction hierarchies as an example. Furthermore, we show how to use Cousots' concept of abstract interpretation on these routing problems generalizing the idea of routing approximations, which can be used to find approximative solutions and even to improve the performance of exact queries. The focus of this paper lies on vehicle routing while both the functional and algebraic routing models were introduced in the context of internet routing. Due to our formal combination of both fields, new algorithms abound for various specialized vehicle routing problems. We consider two major examples, namely the time-dependent routing problem for public transportation and the energy-efficient routing problem for electric vehicles.",IJCAI
Online Mechanism Design for Electric Vehicle Charging,2011,"Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are expected to place a considerable strain on local electricity distribution networks, requiring charging to be coordinated in order to accommodate capacity constraints. We design a novel online auction protocol for this problem, wherein vehicle owners use agents to bid for power and also state time windows in which a vehicle is available for charging. This is a multi-dimensional mechanism design domain, with owners having non-increasing marginal valuations for each subsequent unit of electricity. In our design, we couple a greedy allocation algorithm with the occasional ""burning"" of allocated power, leaving it unallocated, in order to adjust an allocation and achieve monotonicity and thus truthfulness. We consider two variations: burning at each time step or on-departure. Both mechanisms are evaluated in depth, using data from a real-world trial of electric vehicles in the UK to simulate system dynamics and valuations. The mechanisms provide higher allocative efficiency than a fixed price system, are almost competitive with a standard scheduling heuristic which assumes non-strategic agents, and can sustain a substantially larger number of vehicles at the same per-owner fuel cost saving than a simple random scheme.",AAMAS
Joule Counting Correction for Electric Vehicles Using Artificial Neural Networks,2014,"Estimating the remaining energy in high-capacity electric vehicle batteries is essential to safe and efficient operation. Accurate estimation remains a major challenge, however, because battery state cannot be observed directly. In this paper, we demonstrate a method for estimating battery remaining energy using real data collected from the Charge Car electric vehicle. This new method relies on energy integration as an initial estimation step, which is then corrected using a neural net that learns how error accumulates from recent charge/discharge cycles. In this way, the algorithm is able to adapt to nonlinearities and variations that are difficult to model or characterize. On the collected dataset, this method is demonstrated to be accurate to within 2.5% to 5% of battery remaining energy, which equates to approximately 1 to 2 miles of residual range for the Charge Car given its 10kWh battery pack.",AAAI
Efficient Energy-Optimal Routing for Electric Vehicles,2011,"Traditionally routing has focused on finding shortest paths in networks with positive, static edge costs representing the distance between two nodes. Energy-optimal routing for electric vehicles creates novel algorithmic challenges, as simply understanding edge costs as energy values and applying standard algorithms does not work. First, edge costs can be negative due to recuperation, excluding Dijkstra-like algorithms. Second, edge costs may depend on parameters such as vehicle weight only known at query time, ruling out existing preprocessing techniques. Third, considering battery capacity limitations implies that the cost of a path is no longer just the sum of its edge costs. This paper shows how these challenges can be met within the framework of A* search. We show how the specific domain gives rise to a consistent heuristic function yielding an O(n2) routing algorithm. Moreover, we show how battery constraints can be treated by dynamically adapting edge costs and hence can be handled in the same way as parameters given at query time, without increasing run-time complexity. Experimental results with real road networks and vehicle data demonstrate the advantages of our solution.",AAAI

In recent years, data-driven predictive modeling approaches have been increasingly recognized as promising techniques to help enhance healthcare quality and reduce cost. In this paper, we propose a data-driven comprehensive risk prediction method, named LINKAGE, which can be used to jointly assess a set of associated risks in support of holistic care management. Our method can not only perform prediction but also discover the relationships among those risks. The advantages of the proposed model include: 1) It can leverage the relationship between risks and domains and achieve better risk prediction performance; 2) It provides a data-driven approach to understand relationship between risks; 3) It leverages the information between risk prediction and risk association learning to regulate the improvement on both parts; 4) It provides flexibility to incorporate domain knowledge in learning risk associations. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed model on synthetic data and a real-world healthcare survey data set.",KDD
Restless Bandits visiting Villages: A Preliminary Study on distributing Public Health Services,2018,"Distributing public health services is a major challenge. Health workers are responsible for spreading awareness about preventable health problems among the general public by physically visiting the at-risk individuals. However, a limited number of health workers are often responsible for a large population with a variety of health problems. It is therefore essential to design an effective policy to maximize the coverage and spread of health information with limited resources. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical visitation policy design, scalable to regions of various sizes and diversities, which consists of two levels of planning: i) Macro-level planning (region-level) by adapting the p-functional regions problem (PFRP) to our setting, and ii) Micro-level planning (village-level) by formulating a restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) model and using POMDPs with Whittle Index Policy. We also consider how to address the heterogeneity of health problems across villages to ensure better service delivery and the dynamic nature of public health priorities, which have not been attempted in previous literature, to the best of our knowledge. Our preliminary experiments show promising results which demonstrate the potential of this methodology to be applied for health policy planning.",COMPASS
Modeling Multi-Attribute Demand for Sustainable Cloud Computing with Copulae,2015,"As cloud computing gains in popularity, understanding the patterns and structure of its loads is increasingly important in order to drive effective resource allocation, scheduling and pricing decisions. These efficiency increases are then associated with a reduction in the data center environmental footprint. Existing models have only treated a single resource type, such as CPU, or memory, at a time. We offer a sophisticated machine learning approach to capture the joint-distribution. We capture the relationship among multiple resources by carefully fitting both the marginal distributions of each resource type as well as the non-linear structure of their correlation via a copula distribution. We investigate several choices for both models by studying a public data set of Google data-center usage. We show the Burr XII distribution to be a particularly effective choice for modeling the marginals and the Frank copula to be the best choice for stitching these together into a joint distribution. Our approach offers a significant fidelity improvement and generalizes directly to higher dimensions. In use, this improvement will translate directly to reductions in energy consumption.",IJCAI
Two-Sided Online Markets for Electric Vehicle Charging (Page 989),2013,"With the growing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs), the number of public charging stations is increasing rapidly, allowing drivers to charge their cars while parked away from home or en-route to their destination. However, as a full charge can take a significant amount of time, drivers may face queues and uncertainty over availability of charging facilities at different stations and times. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a novel, two-sided market for advance reservations, in which agents, representing EV owners, report their preferences for time slots and charging locations, while charging stations report their availability and costs. In our model, both parties are rational, profit-maximising entities, and buyers enter the market dynamically over time. Given this, we apply techniques from online mechanism design to develop a pricing mechanism which is truthful on the buyer side (i.e., drivers have no incentive to misreport their preferences or to delay their reservations). For the seller side, we adapt three well-known pricing mechanisms and compare them both theoretically and empirically. Using realistic simulations, we demonstrate that two of our proposed mechanisms consistently achieve a high efficiency (90-95% of optimal), while offering a trade-off between stability and budget balance. Surprisingly, the third mechanism, a common payment mechanism that is truthful in simpler settings, achieves a significantly lower efficiency and runs a high deficit.",AAMAS
Optimal Electric Vehicle Charging Station Placement,2015,"Many countries like Singapore are planning to introduce Electric Vehicles (EVs) to replace traditional vehicles to reduce air pollution and improve energy efficiency. The rapid development of EVs calls for efficient deployment of charging stations both for the convenience of EVs and maintaining the efficiency of the road network. Unfortunately, existing work makes unrealistic assumption on EV drivers' charging behaviors and focus on the limited mobility of EVs. This paper studies the Charging Station PLacement (CSPL) problem, and takes into consideration 1) EV drivers' strategic behaviors to minimize their charging cost, and 2) the mutual impact of EV drivers' strategies on the traffic conditions of the road network and service quality of charging stations. We first formulate the CSPL problem as a bilevel optimization problem, which is subsequently converted to a single-level optimization problem by exploiting structures of the EV charging game played by EV drivers. Properties of CSPL problem are analyzed and an algorithm called OCEAN is proposed to compute the optimal allocation of charging stations. We further propose a heuristic algorithm OCEAN-C to speed up OCEAN. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform baseline methods.",IJCAI
Spatial Scan for Disease Mapping on a Mobile Population,2014,"In disease mapping, the spatial scan statistic is used to detect spatial regions where population is exposed to a significantly higher disease risk than expected. In this important application, the current residence is typically used to define the location of individuals from the population. Considering the mobility of humans at various temporal and spatial scales, using only information about the current residence may be an insufficiently informative proxy because it ignores a multitude of exposures that may occur away from home, or which had occurred at previous residences. In this paper, we propose a spatial scan statistic that is appropriate for disease mapping on mobile populations. We formulate a computationally efficient algorithm that uses the proposed statistic to find significant high-risk regions from mobile population's disease status data. The algorithm is applicable on large populations and over dense spatial grids. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is computationally efficient and outperforms the traditional disease clustering approaches at discovering high-risk regions in mobile populations.",AAAI
Boosted Decision Tree Regression Adjustment for Variance Reduction in Online Controlled Experiments,2016,"Nowadays, the development of most leading web services is controlled by online experiments that qualify and quantify the steady stream of their updates achieving more than a thousand concurrent experiments per day. Despite the increasing need for running more experiments, these services are limited in their user traffic. This situation leads to the problem of finding a new or improving existing key performance metric with a higher sensitivity and lower variance. We focus on the problem of variance reduction for engagement metrics of user loyalty that are widely used in A/B testing of web services. We develop a general framework that is based on evaluation of the mean difference between the actual and the approximated values of the key performance metric (instead of the mean of this metric). On the one hand, it allows us to incorporate the state-of-the-art techniques widely used in randomized experiments of clinical and social research, but limitedly used in online evaluation. On the other hand, we propose a new class of methods based on advanced machine learning algorithms, including ensembles of decision trees, that, to the best of our knowledge, have not been applied earlier to the problem of variance reduction. We validate the variance reduction approaches on a very large set of real large-scale A/B experiments run at Yandex for different engagement metrics of user loyalty. Our best approach demonstrates $63\%$ average variance reduction (which is equivalent to 63% saved user traffic) and detects the treatment effect in $2$ times more A/B experiments.",KDD
Agent-Based Decision Support: A Case-Study on DSL Access Networks,2010,"Network management is a complex task involving various challenges, such as the heterogeneity of the infrastructure or the information flood caused by billions of log messages from different systems and operated by different organiza- tional units. All of these messages and systems may contain information relevant to other operational units. For example, in order to ensure reliable DSL connections for IPTV cus- tomers, optimal customer traffic path assignments for the current network state and traffic demands need to be evalu- ated. Currently reassignments are only manually performed during routine maintenance or as a response to reported problems. In this paper we present a decision support sys- tem for this task. In addition, the system predicts future pos- sible demands and allows reconfigurations of a DSL access network before congestions may occur.",AAAI
Interacting viruses in networks: can both survive?,2012,"Suppose we have two competing ideas/products/viruses, that propagate over a social or other network. Suppose that they are strong/virulent enough, so that each, if left alone, could lead to an epidemic. What will happen when both operate on the network? Earlier models assume that there is perfect competition: if a user buys product 'A' (or gets infected with virus 'X'), she will never buy product 'B' (or virus 'Y'). This is not always true: for example, a user could install and use both Firefox and Google Chrome as browsers. Similarly, one type of flu may give partial immunity against some other similar disease.
 In the case of full competition, it is known that 'winner takes all,' that is the weaker virus/product will become extinct. In the case of no competition, both viruses survive, ignoring each other. What happens in-between these two extremes?
 We show that there is a phase transition: if the competition is harsher than a critical level, then 'winner takes all;' otherwise, the weaker virus survives. These are the contributions of this paper (a) the problem definition, which is novel even in epidemiology literature (b) the phase-transition result and (c) experiments on real data, illustrating the suitability of our results.",KDD
Predicting Clinical Outcomes Across Changing Electronic Health Record Systems,2017,"Existing machine learning methods typically assume consistency in how semantically equivalent information is encoded. However, the way information is recorded in databases differs across institutions and over time, often rendering potentially useful data obsolescent. To address this problem, we map database-specific representations of information to a shared set of semantic concepts, thus allowing models to be built from or transition across different databases. We demonstrate our method on machine learning models developed in a healthcare setting. In particular, we evaluate our method using two different intensive care unit (ICU) databases and on two clinically relevant tasks, in-hospital mortality and prolonged length of stay. For both outcomes, a feature representation mapping EHR-specific events to a shared set of clinical concepts yields better results than using EHR-specific events alone.",KDD
A Unifying Variational Inference Framework for Hierarchical Graph-Coupled HMM with an Application to Influenza Infection,2016,"The Hierarchical Graph-Coupled Hidden Markov Model (hGCHMM) is a useful tool for tracking and predicting the spread of contagious diseases, such as influenza, by leveraging social contact data collected from individual wearable devices. However, the existing inference algorithms depend on the assumption that the infection rates are small in probability, typically close to 0. The purpose of this paper is to build a unified learning framework for latent infection state estimation for the hGCHMM, regardless of the infection rate and transition function. We derive our algorithm based on a dynamic auto-encoding variational inference scheme, thus potentially generalizing the hGCHMM to models other than those that work on highly contagious diseases. We experimentally compare our approach with previous Gibbs EM algorithms and standard variational method mean-field inference, on both semi-synthetic data and app collected epidemiological and social records.",AAAI
Global Climate Model Tracking Using Geospatial Neighborhoods,2012,"A key problem in climate science is how to combine the predictions of the multi-model ensemble of global climate models. Recent work in machine learning (Monteleoni et al. 2011) showed the promise of an algorithm for online learning with experts for this task.We extend the Tracking Climate Models (TCM) approach to (1) take into account climate model predictions at higher spatial resolutions and (2) to model geospatial neighborhood influence between regions. Our algorithm enables neighborhood influence by modifying the transition dynamics of the Hidden Markov Model used by TCM, allowing the performance of spatial neighbors to influence the temporal switching probabilities for the best expert (climate model) at a given location. In experiments on historical data at a variety of spatial resolutions, our algorithm demonstrates improvements over TCM, when tracking global temperature anomalies.",AAAI
An Intelligent Battery Controller Using Bias-Corrected Q-learning,2012,"The transition to renewables requires storage to help smooth short-term variations in energy from wind and solar sources, as well as to respond to spikes in electricity spot prices, which can easily exceed 20 times their average. Efficient operation of an energy storage device is a fundamental problem, yet classical algorithms such as $Q$-learning can diverge for millions of iterations, limiting practical applications. We have traced this behavior to the max-operator bias, which is exacerbated by high volatility in the reward function, and high discount factors due to the small time steps. We propose an elegant bias correction procedure and demonstrate its effectiveness.",AAAI
Adaptive Home Heating Under Weather and Price Uncertainty Using GPs and MDPs (Page 821),2014,"We consider the problem of adaptive home heating in the smart grid, assuming that real-time electricity prices are being exposed to end-users with the goal of realizing demand-side management. To lower the burden on the end-users, our goal is the design of a smart thermostat that automatically heats the home, optimally trading off the user's comfort and cost. This is a challenging problem due to two sources of uncertainty: future weather conditions and future electricity prices. Our main technical contribution is a general technique that uses predictive distributions obtained from Gaussian Process (GP) regressions to compute the state transition probabilities of an MDP, such that the solution to the resulting MDP constitutes a sequentially optimal policy. We apply this general approach to the home-heating problem, where we use the predictive distributions of the GPs for the day-ahead external temperatures and electricity prices. The solution to the home-heating MDP constitutes an optimal heating policy that maximizes the user's utility given the probability information gathered by the Gaussian process model. Via simulations we show that our MDP-based approach outperforms various benchmarks, especially for cost-sensitive users.",AAMAS
An MDP-Based Winning Approach to Autonomous Power Trading: Formalization and Empirical Analysis (Page 827),2016,"With the efforts of moving to sustainable and reliable energy supply, electricity markets are undergoing far-reaching changes. Due to the high-cost of failure in the real-world, it is important to test new market structures in simulation. This is the focus of the Power Trading Agent Competition (Power TAC), which proposes autonomous electricity broker agents as a means for stabilizing the electricity grid. This paper focuses on the question: how should an autonomous electricity broker agent act in competitive electricity markets to maximize its profit. We formalize the electricity trading problem as a continuous, high-dimensional Markov Decision Process (MDP), which is computationally intractable to solve. Our formalization provides a guideline for approximating the MDP's solution, and for extending existing solutions. We show that a previously champion broker can be viewed as approximating the solution using a lookahead policy. We present TacTex'15, which improves upon this previous approximation and achieves state-of-the-art performance in competitions and controlled experiments. Using thousands of experiments against 2015 finalist brokers, we analyze TacTex'15's performance and the reasons for its success. We find that lookahead policies can be effective, but their performance can be sensitive to errors in the transition function prediction, specifically demand-prediction.",AAMAS
Fast-Tracking Stationary MOMDPs for Adaptive Management Problems,2017,"Adaptive management is applied in conservation and natural resource management, and consists of making sequential decisions when the transition matrix is uncertain. Informally described as Ã¢â¬â¢learning by doingÃ¢â¬â¢, this approach aims to trade off between decisions that help achieve the objective and decisions that will yield a better knowledge of the true transition matrix. When the true transition matrix is assumed to be an element of a finite set of possible matrices, solving a mixed observability Markov decision process (MOMDP) leads to an optimal trade-off but is very computationally demanding. Under the assumption (common in adaptive management) that the true transition matrix is stationary, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm to find a lower bound of the value function. In the corners of the domain of the value function (belief space), this lower bound is provably equal to the optimal value function. We also show that under further assumptions, it is a linear approximation of the optimal value function in a neighborhood around the corners. We evaluate the benefits of our approach by using it to initialize the solvers MO-SARSOP and Perseus on a novel computational sustainability problem and a recent adaptive management data challenge. Our approach leads to an improved initial value function and translates into significant computational gains for both solvers.",AAAI
Multi-Modality Disease Modeling via Collective Deep Matrix Factorization,2017,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most common causes of dementia, is a severe irreversible neurodegenerative disease that results in loss of mental functions. The transitional stage between the expected cognitive decline of normal aging and AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), has been widely regarded as a suitable time for possible therapeutic intervention. The challenging task of MCI detection is therefore of great clinical importance, where the key is to effectively fuse predictive information from multiple heterogeneous data sources collected from the patients. In this paper, we propose a framework to fuse multiple data modalities for predictive modeling using deep matrix factorization, which explores the non-linear interactions among the modalities and exploits such interactions to transfer knowledge and enable high performance prediction. Specifically, the proposed collective deep matrix factorization decomposes all modalities simultaneously to capture non-linear structures of the modalities in a supervised manner, and learns a modality specific component for each modality and a modality invariant component across all modalities. The modality invariant component serves as a compact feature representation of patients that has high predictive power. The modality specific components provide an effective means to explore imaging genetics, yielding insights into how imaging and genotype interact with each other non-linearly in the AD pathology. Extensive empirical studies using various data modalities provided by Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for fusing heterogeneous modalities.",KDD
Emerging Applications for Intelligent Diabetes Management,2011,"Diabetes management is a difficult task for patients, who must monitor and control their blood glucose levels in order to avoid serious diabetic complications.

Identifying Differences in Physician Communication Styles with a Log-Linear Transition Component Model,2014,"We consider the task of grouping doctors with respect to communication patterns exhibited in outpatient visits. We propose a novel approach toward this end in which we model speech act transitions in conversations via a log-linear model incorporating physician specific components. We train this model over transcripts of outpatient visits annotated with speech act codes and then cluster physicians in (a transformation of) this parameter space. We find significant correlations between the induced groupings and patient survey response data comprising ratings of physician communication. Furthermore, the novel sequential component model we leverage to induce this clustering allows us to explore differences across these groups. This work demonstrates how statistical AI might be used to better understand (and ultimately improve) physician communication.",AAAI
Anatomy of a Privacy-Safe Large-Scale Information Extraction System Over Email,2018,"Extracting structured data from emails can enable several assistive experiences, such as reminding the user when a bill payment is due, answering queries about the departure time of a booked flight, or proactively surfacing an emailed discount coupon while the user is at that store. This paper presents Juicer, a system for extracting information from email that is serving over a billion Gmail users daily. We describe how the design of the system was informed by three key principles: scaling to a planet-wide email service, isolating the complexity to provide a simple experience for the developer, and safeguarding the privacy of users (our team and the developers we support are not allowed to view any single email). We describe the design tradeoffs made in building this system, the challenges faced and the approaches used to tackle them. We present case studies of three extraction tasks implemented on this platform---bill reminders, commercial offers, and hotel reservations---to illustrate the effectiveness of the platform despite challenges unique to each task. Finally, we outline several areas of ongoing research in large-scale machine-learned information extraction from email.",KDD
Instance Weighting for Patient-Specific Risk Stratification Models,2015,"Accurate risk models for adverse outcomes can provide important input to clinical decision-making. Surprisingly, one of the main challenges when using machine learning to build clinically useful risk models is the small amount of data available. Risk models need to be developed for specific patient populations, specific institutions, specific procedures, and specific outcomes. With each exclusion criterion, the amount of relevant training data decreases, until there is often an insufficient amount to learn an accurate model. This difficulty is compounded by the large class imbalance that is often present in medical applications.
 In this paper, we present an approach to address the problem of small data using transfer learning methods in the context of developing risk models for cardiac surgeries. We explore ways to build surgery-specific and hospital-specific models (the target task) using information from other kinds of surgeries and other hospitals (source tasks). We propose a novel method to weight examples based on their similarity to the target task training examples to take advantage of the useful examples while discounting less relevant ones.
 We show that incorporating appropriate source data in training can lead to improved performance over using only target task training data, and that our method of instance weighting can lead to further improvements. Applied to a surgical risk stratification task, our method, which used data from two institutions, performed comparably to the risk model published by the Society for Thoracic Surgeons, which was developed and tested on over one hundred thousand surgeries from hundreds of institutions.",KDD
SEGAN: Structure-Enhanced Generative Adversarial Network for Compressed Sensing MRI Reconstruction,2019,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are powerful tools for reconstructing Compressed Sensing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CS-MRI). However most recent works lack exploration of structure information of MRI images that is crucial for clinical diagnosis. To tackle this problem, we propose the Structure-Enhanced GAN (SEGAN) that aims at restoring structure information at both local and global scale. SEGAN defines a new structure regularization called Patch Correlation Regularization (PCR) which allows for efficient extraction of structure information. In addition, to further enhance the ability to uncover structure information, we propose a novel generator SU-Net by incorporating multiple-scale convolution filters into each layer. Besides, we theoretically analyze the convergence of stochastic factors contained in training process. Experimental results show that SEGAN is able to learn target structure information and achieves state-of-theart performance for CS-MRI reconstruction.",AAAI
FeaFiner: biomarker identification from medical data through feature generalization and selection,2013,"Traditionally, feature construction and feature selection are two important but separate processes in data mining. However, many real world applications require an integrated approach for creating, refining and selecting features. To address this problem, we propose FeaFiner (short for Feature Refiner), an efficient formulation that simultaneously generalizes low-level features into higher level concepts and then selects relevant concepts based on the target variable. Specifically, we formulate a double sparsity optimization problem that identifies groups in the low-level features, generalizes higher level features using the groups and performs feature selection. Since in many clinical researches non- overlapping groups are preferred for better interpretability, we further improve the formulation to generalize features using mutually exclusive feature groups. The proposed formulation is challenging to solve due to the orthogonality constraints, non-convexity objective and non-smoothness penal- ties. We apply a recently developed augmented Lagrangian method to solve this formulation in which each subproblem is solved by a non-monotone spectral projected gradient method. Our numerical experiments show that this approach is computationally efficient and also capable of producing solutions of high quality. We also present a generalization bound showing the consistency and the asymptotic behavior of the learning process of our proposed formulation.
 Finally, the proposed FeaFiner method is validated on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset, where low-level biomarkers are automatically generalized into robust higher level concepts which are then selected for predicting the disease status measured by Mini Mental State Examination and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscore. Compared to existing predictive modeling methods, FeaFiner provides intuitive and robust feature concepts and competitive predictive accuracy.",KDD
A Permutation Approach to Assess Confounding in Machine Learning Applications for Digital Health,2019,"Machine learning applications are often plagued with confounders that can impact the generalizability of the learners. In clinical settings, demographic characteristics often play the role of confounders. Confounding is especially problematic in remote digital health studies where the participants self-select to enter the study, thereby making it difficult to balance the demographic characteristics of participants. One effective approach to combat confounding is to match samples with respect to the confounding variables in order to improve the balance of the data. This procedure, however, leads to smaller datasets and hence negatively impact the inferences drawn from the learners. Alternatively, confounding adjustment methods that make more efficient use of the data (such as inverse probability weighting) usually rely on modeling assumptions, and it is unclear how robust these methods are to violations of these assumptions. Here, instead of proposing a new method to control for confounding, we develop novel permutation based statistical tools to detect and quantify the influence of observed confounders, and estimate the unconfounded performance of the learner. Our tools can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of existing confounding adjustment methods. We evaluate the statistical properties of our methods in a simulation study, and illustrate their application using real-life data from a Parkinson's disease mobile health study collected in an uncontrolled environment.",KDD
Deep-Treat: Learning Optimal Personalized Treatments From Observational Data Using Neural Networks,2018,We propose a novel approach for constructing effective treatment policies when the observed data is biased and lacks counterfactual information. Learning in settings where the observed data does not contain all possible outcomes for all treatments is difficult since the observed data is typically biased due to existing clinical guidelines. This is an important problem in the medical domain as collecting unbiased data is expensive and so learning from the wealth of existing biased data is a worthwhile task. Our approach separates the problem into two stages: first we reduce the bias by learning a representation map using a novel auto-encoder network---this allows us to control the trade-off between the bias-reduction and the information loss---and then we construct effective treatment policies on the transformed data using a novel feedforward network. Separation of the problem into these two stages creates an algorithm that can be adapted to the problem at hand---the bias-reduction step can be performed as a preprocessing step for other algorithms. We compare our algorithm against state-of-art algorithms on two semi-synthetic datasets and demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a significant improvement in performance.,AAAI
Federated Tensor Factorization for Computational Phenotyping,2017,"Tensor factorization models offer an effective approach to convert massive electronic health records into meaningful clinical concepts (phenotypes) for data analysis. These models need a large amount of diverse samples to avoid population bias. An open challenge is how to derive phenotypes jointly across multiple hospitals, in which direct patient-level data sharing is not possible (e.g., due to institutional policies). In this paper, we developed a novel solution to enable federated tensor factorization for computational phenotyping without sharing patient-level data. We developed secure data harmonization and federated computation procedures based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Using this method, the multiple hospitals iteratively update tensors and transfer secure summarized information to a central server, and the server aggregates the information to generate phenotypes. We demonstrated with real medical datasets that our method resembles the centralized training model (based on combined datasets) in terms of accuracy and phenotypes discovery while respecting privacy.",KDD
Deep Computational Phenotyping,2015,"We apply deep learning to the problem of discovery and detection of characteristic patterns of physiology in clinical time series data. We propose two novel modifications to standard neural net training that address challenges and exploit properties that are peculiar, if not exclusive, to medical data. First, we examine a general framework for using prior knowledge to regularize parameters in the topmost layers. This framework can leverage priors of any form, ranging from formal ontologies (e.g., ICD9 codes) to data-derived similarity. Second, we describe a scalable procedure for training a collection of neural networks of different sizes but with partially shared architectures. Both of these innovations are well-suited to medical applications, where available data are not yet Internet scale and have many sparse outputs (e.g., rare diagnoses) but which have exploitable structure (e.g., temporal order and relationships between labels). However, both techniques are sufficiently general to be applied to other problems and domains. We demonstrate the empirical efficacy of both techniques on two real-world hospital data sets and show that the resulting neural nets learn interpretable and clinically relevant features.",KDD
Rubik: Knowledge Guided Tensor Factorization and Completion for Health Data Analytics,2015,"Computational phenotyping is the process of converting heterogeneous electronic health records (EHRs) into meaningful clinical concepts. Unsupervised phenotyping methods have the potential to leverage a vast amount of labeled EHR data for phenotype discovery. However, existing unsupervised phenotyping methods do not incorporate current medical knowledge and cannot directly handle missing, or noisy data.
 We propose Rubik, a constrained non-negative tensor factorization and completion method for phenotyping. Rubik incorporates 1) guidance constraints to align with existing medical knowledge, and 2) pairwise constraints for obtaining distinct, non-overlapping phenotypes. Rubik also has built-in tensor completion that can significantly alleviate the impact of noisy and missing data. We utilize the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) framework to tensor factorization and completion, which can be easily scaled through parallel computing.
 We evaluate Rubik on two EHR datasets, one of which contains 647,118 records for 7,744 patients from an outpatient clinic, the other of which is a public dataset containing 1,018,614 CMS claims records for 472,645 patients. Our results show that Rubik can discover more meaningful and distinct phenotypes than the baselines. In particular, by using knowledge guidance constraints, Rubik can also discover sub-phenotypes for several major diseases. Rubik also runs around seven times faster than current state-of-the-art tensor methods. Finally, Rubik is scalable to large datasets containing millions of EHR records.",KDD
MINA: Multilevel Knowledge-Guided Attention for Modeling Electrocardiography Signals,2019,"Electrocardiography (ECG) signals are commonly used to diagnose various cardiac abnormalities. Recently, deep learning models showed initial success on modeling ECG data, however they are mostly black-box, thus lack interpretability needed for clinical usage. In this work, we propose MultIlevel kNowledge-guided Attention networks (MINA) that predict heart diseases from ECG signals with intuitive explanation aligned with medical knowledge. By extracting multilevel (beat-, rhythm- and frequency-level) domain knowledge features separately, MINA combines the medical knowledge and ECG data via a multilevel attention model, making the learned models highly interpretable. Our experiments showed MINA achieved PR-AUC 0.9436 (outperforming the best baseline by 5.51%) in real world ECG dataset. Finally, MINA also demonstrated robust performance and strong interpretability against signal distortion and noise contamination.",IJCAI
Deep Multi-Output Forecasting: Learning to Accurately Predict Blood Glucose Trajectories,2018,"In many forecasting applications, it is valuable to predict not only the value of a signal at a certain time point in the future, but also the values leading up to that point. This is especially true in clinical applications, where the future state of the patient can be less important than the patient's overall trajectory. This requires multi-step forecasting, a forecasting variant where one aims to predict multiple values in the future simultaneously. Standard methods to accomplish this can propagate error from prediction to prediction, reducing quality over the long term. In light of these challenges, we propose multi-output deep architectures for multi-step forecasting in which we explicitly model the distribution of future values of the signal over a prediction horizon. We apply these techniques to the challenging and clinically relevant task of blood glucose forecasting. Through a series of experiments on a real-world dataset consisting of 550K blood glucose measurements, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches in capturing the underlying signal dynamics. Compared to existing shallow and deep methods, we find that our proposed approaches improve performance individually and capture complementary information, leading to a large improvement over the baseline when combined (4.87 vs. 5.31 absolute percentage error (APE)). Overall, the results suggest the efficacy of our proposed approach in predicting blood glucose level and multi-step forecasting more generally.",KDD
Learning Tasks for Multitask Learning: Heterogenous Patient Populations in the ICU,2018,"Machine learning approaches have been effective in predicting adverse outcomes in different clinical settings. These models are often developed and evaluated on datasets with heterogeneous patient populations. However, good predictive performance on the aggregate population does not imply good performance for specific groups. In this work, we present a two-step framework to 1) learn relevant patient subgroups, and 2) predict an outcome for separate patient populations in a multi-task framework, where each population is a separate task. We demonstrate how to discover relevant groups in an unsupervised way with a sequence-to-sequence autoencoder. We show that using these groups in a multi-task framework leads to better predictive performance of in-hospital mortality both across groups and overall. We also highlight the need for more granular evaluation of performance when dealing with heterogeneous populations.",KDD
From micro to macro: data driven phenotyping by densification of longitudinal electronic medical records,2014,"Inferring phenotypic patterns from population-scale clinical data is a core computational task in the development of personalized medicine. One important source of data on which to conduct this type of research is patient Electronic Medical Records (EMR). However, the patient EMRs are typically sparse and noisy, which creates significant challenges if we use them directly to represent patient phenotypes. In this paper, we propose a data driven phenotyping framework called Pacifier (PAtient reCord densIFIER), where we interpret the longitudinal EMR data of each patient as a sparse matrix with a feature dimension and a time dimension, and derive more robust patient phenotypes by exploring the latent structure of those matrices. Specifically, we assume that each derived phenotype is composed of a subset of the medical features contained in original patient EMR, whose value evolves smoothly over time. We propose two formulations to achieve such goal. One is Individual Basis Approach (IBA), which assumes the phenotypes are different for every patient. The other is Shared Basis Approach (SBA), which assumes the patient population shares a common set of phenotypes. We develop an efficient optimization algorithm that is capable of resolving both problems efficiently. Finally we validate Pacifier on two real world EMR cohorts for the tasks of early prediction of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) and End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Our results show that the predictive performance in both tasks can be improved significantly by the proposed algorithms (average AUC score improved from 0.689 to 0.816 on CHF, and from 0.756 to 0.838 on ESRD respectively, on diagnosis group granularity). We also illustrate some interesting phenotypes derived from our data.",KDD
Balancing Appearance and Context in Sketch Interpretation,2016,"We describe a sketch interpretation system that detects and classifies clock numerals created by subjects taking the Clock Drawing Test, a clinical tool widely used to screen for cognitive impairments (e.g., dementia). We describe how it balances appearance and context, and document its performance on some 2,000 drawings (about 24K clock numerals) produced by a wide spectrum of patients. We calibrate the utility of different forms of context, describing experiments with Conditional Random Fields trained and tested using a variety of features. We identify context that contributes to interpreting otherwise ambiguous or incomprehensible strokes. We describe ST-slices, a novel representation that enables ""unpeeling"" the layers of ink that result when people overwrite, which often produces ink impossible to analyze if only the final drawing is examined. We characterize when ST-slices work, calibrate their impact on performance, and consider their breadth of applicability.",IJCAI
Learning Implicit Tasks for Patient-Specific Risk Modeling in ICU,2017,"Accurate assessment of the severity of a patientÃ¢â¬â¢s condition plays a fundamental role in acute hospital care such as that provided in an intensive care unit (ICU). ICU clinicians are required to make sense of a large amount of clinical data in a limited time to estimate the severity of a patientÃ¢â¬â¢s condition, which ultimately leads to the planning of appropriate care. The ICU is an especially demanding environment for clinicians because of the diversity of patients who mostly suffer from multiple diseases of various types. In this paper, we propose a mortality risk prediction method for ICU patients. The method is intended to enhance the severity assessment by considering the diversity of patients. Our method produces patient-specific risk models that reflect the collection of diseases associated with the patient. Specifically, we assume a small number of latent basis tasks, where each latent task is associated with its own parameter vector; a parameter vector for a specific patient is constructed as a linear combination of these. The latent representation of a patient, namely, the coefficients of the combination, is learned based on the collection of diseases associated with the patient. Our method could be considered a multi-task learning method where latent tasks are learned based on the collection of diseases. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method using a dataset collected from a hospital. Our method achieved higher predictive performance compared with a single-task learning method, the Ã¢â¬Åde facto standard,Ã¢â¬Â and several multi-task learning methods including a recently proposed method for ICU mortality risk prediction. Furthermore, our proposed method could be used not only for predictions but also for uncovering patient-specificity from different viewpoints.",AAAI
Ensemble Machine Learning for Estimating Fetal Weight at Varying Gestational Age,2019,"Obstetric ultrasound examination of physiological parameters has been mainly used to estimate the fetal weight during pregnancy and baby weight before labour to monitor fetal growth and reduce prenatal morbidity and mortality. However, the problem is that ultrasound estimation of fetal weight is subject to populationsÃ¢â¬â¢ difference, strict operating requirements for sonographers, and poor access to ultrasound in low-resource areas. Inaccurate estimations may lead to negative perinatal outcomes. We consider that machine learning can provide an accurate estimation for obstetricians alongside traditional clinical practices, as well as an efficient and effective support tool for pregnant women for self-monitoring. We present a robust methodology using a data set comprising 4,212 intrapartum recordings. The cubic spline function is used to fit the curves of several key characteristics that are extracted from ultrasound reports. A number of simple and powerful machine learning algorithms are trained, and their performance is evaluated with real test data. We also propose a novel evaluation performance index called the intersectionover-union (loU) for our study. The results are encouraging using an ensemble model consisting of Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM algorithms. The experimental results show an loU of 0.64 between predicted range of fetal weight at any gestational age from the ensemble model and that from ultrasound. Comparing with the ultrasound method, the estimation accuracy is improved by 12%, and the mean relative error is reduced by 3%.",AAAI
Mitosis Detection in Breast Cancer Histology Images via Deep Cascaded Networks,2016,"The number of mitoses per tissue area gives an important aggressiveness indication of the invasive breast carcinoma.However, automatic mitosis detection in histology images remains a challenging problem. Traditional methods either employ hand-crafted features to discriminate mitoses from other cells or construct a pixel-wise classifier to label every pixel in a sliding window way. While the former suffers from the large shape variation of mitoses and the existence of many mimics with similar appearance, the slow speed of the later prohibits its use in clinical practice.In order to overcome these shortcomings, we propose a fast and accurate method to detect mitosis by designing a novel deep cascaded convolutional neural network, which is composed of two components. First, by leveraging the fully convolutional neural network, we propose a coarse retrieval model to identify and locate the candidates of mitosis while preserving a high sensitivity.Based on these candidates, a fine discrimination model utilizing knowledge transferred from cross-domain is developed to further single out mitoses from hard mimics.Our approach outperformed other methods by a large margin in 2014 ICPR MITOS-ATYPIA challenge in terms of detection accuracy. When compared with the state-of-the-art methods on the 2012 ICPR MITOSIS data (a smaller and less challenging dataset), our method achieved comparable or better results with a roughly 60 times faster speed.",AAAI
Statistical Relational Learning to Predict Primary Myocardial Infarction from Electronic Health Records,2012,"Electronic health records (EHRs) are an emerging relational domain with large potential to improve clinical outcomes. We apply two statistical relational learning (SRL) algorithms to the task of predicting primary myocardial infarction. We show that one SRL algorithm, relational functional gradient boosting, outperforms propositional learners particularly in the medically-relevant high recall region. We observe that both SRL algorithms predict outcomes better than their propositional analogs and suggest how our methods can augment current epidemiological practices.",AAAI
Supervised Reinforcement Learning with Recurrent Neural Network for Dynamic Treatment Recommendation,2018,"Dynamic treatment recommendation systems based on large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) become a key to successfully improve practical clinical outcomes. Prior relevant studies recommend treatments either use supervised learning (e.g. matching the indicator signal which denotes doctor prescriptions), or reinforcement learning (e.g. maximizing evaluation signal which indicates cumulative reward from survival rates). However, none of these studies have considered to combine the benefits of supervised learning and reinforcement learning. In this paper, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning with Recurrent Neural Network (SRL-RNN), which fuses them into a synergistic learning framework. Specifically, SRL-RNN applies an off-policy actor-critic framework to handle complex relations among multiple medications, diseases and individual characteristics. The ""actor'' in the framework is adjusted by both the indicator signal and evaluation signal to ensure effective prescription and low mortality. RNN is further utilized to solve the Partially-Observed Markov Decision Process (POMDP) problem due to lack of fully observed states in real world applications. Experiments on the publicly real-world dataset, i.e., MIMIC-3, illustrate that our model can reduce the estimated mortality, while providing promising accuracy in matching doctors' prescriptions.",KDD
Multi-view Learning over Retinal Thickness and Visual Sensitivity on Glaucomatous Eyes,2017,"Dense measurements of visual-field, which is necessary to detect glaucoma, is known as very costly and labor intensive. Recently, measurement of retinal-thickness can be less costly than measurement of visual-field. Thus, it is sincerely desired that the retinal-thickness could be transformed into visual-sensitivity data somehow. In this paper, we propose two novel methods to estimate the sensitivity of the visual-field with SITA-Standard mode 10-2 resolution using retinal-thickness data measured with optical coherence tomography (OCT). The first method called Affine-Structured Non-negative Matrix Factorization (ASNMF) which is able to cope with both the estimation of visual-field and the discovery of deep glaucoma knowledge. While, the second is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which demonstrates very high estimation performance. These methods are kinds of multi-view learning methods because they utilize visual-field and retinal thickness data simultaneously. We experimentally tested the performance of our methods from several perspectives. We found that ASNMF worked better for relatively small data size while CNNs did for relatively large data size. In addition, some clinical knowledge are discovered via ASNMF. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to address the dense estimation of the visual-field based on the retinal-thickness data.",KDD
Network discovery via constrained tensor analysis of fMRI data,2013,"We pose the problem of network discovery which involves simplifying spatio-temporal data into cohesive regions (nodes) and relationships between those regions (edges). Such problems naturally exist in fMRI scans of human subjects. These scans consist of activations of thousands of voxels over time with the aim to simplify them into the underlying cognitive network being used. We propose supervised and semi-supervised variations of this problem and postulate a constrained tensor decomposition formulation and a corresponding alternating least squares solver that is easy to implement. We show this formulation works well in controlled experiments where supervision is incomplete, superfluous and noisy and is able to recover the underlying ground truth network. We then show that for real fMRI data our approach can reproduce well known results in neurology regarding the default mode network in resting-state healthy and Alzheimer affected individuals. Finally, we show that the reconstruction error of the decomposition provides a useful measure of the network strength and is useful at predicting key cognitive scores both by itself and with clinical information.",KDD
Truly Batch Apprenticeship Learning with Deep Successor Features,2019,"We introduce a novel apprenticeship learning algorithm to learn an expert's underlying reward structure in off-policy model-free batch settings. Unlike existing methods that require hand-crafted features, on-policy evaluation, further data acquisition for evaluation policies or the knowledge of model dynamics, our algorithm requires only batch data (demonstrations) of the observed expert behavior.Ã Such settings are common in many real-world tasks---health care, finance, or industrial process control---where accurate simulators do not exist and additional data acquisition is costly.Ã We develop a transition-regularized imitation learning model to learn a rich feature representation and a near-expert initial policy that makes the subsequent batch inverse reinforcement learning process viable. We also introduce deep successor feature networks that perform off-policy evaluation to estimate feature expectations of candidate policies. Under the batch setting, our method achieves superior results on control benchmarks as well as a real clinical task of sepsis management in the Intensive Care Unit.",IJCAI
Identifying Semantics in Clinical Reports Using Neural Machine Translation,2019,"Clinical documents are vital resources for radiologists when they have to consult or refer while studying similar cases. In large healthcare facilities where millions of reports are generated, searching for relevant documents is quite challenging. With abundant interchangeable words in clinical domain, understanding the semantics of the words in the clinical documents is vital to improve the search results. This paper details an end to end semantic search application to address the large scale information retrieval problem of clinical reports. The paper specifically focuses on the challenge of identifying semantics in the clinical reports to facilitate search at semantic level. The semantic search works by mapping the documents into the concept space and the search is performed in the concept space. A unique approach of framing the concept mapping problem as a language translation problem is proposed in this paper. The concept mapper is modelled using the Neural machine translation model (NMT) based on encoder-decoder with attention architecture. The regular expression based concept mapper takes approximately 3 seconds to extract UMLS concepts from a single document, where as the trained NMT does the same in approximately 30 milliseconds. NMT based model further enables incorporation of negation detection to identify whether a concept is negated or not, facilitating search for negated queries.",AAAI
DDL: Deep Dictionary Learning for Predictive Phenotyping,2019,"Predictive phenotyping is about accurately predicting what phenotypes will occur in the next clinical visit based on longitudinal Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. Several deep learning (DL) models have demonstrated great performance in predictive phenotyping. However, these DL-based phenotyping models requires access to a large amount of labeled data, which are oftenÃ expensive to acquire. To address this label-insufficient challenge, we propose a deep dictionary learning framework (DDL) for phenotyping, which utilizes unlabeled data as a complementary source of information to generate a better, more succinct data representation. With extensive experiments on multiple real-world EHR datasets, we demonstrated DDL can outperform the state of the art predictive phenotyping methods on a wide variety of clinical tasks that require patient phenotyping such as heart failure classification, mortality prediction, and sequential prediction. All empirical results consistently show that unlabeled data can indeed be used to generate better data representation, which helps improve DDL's phenotyping performance over existing baseline methods that only uses labeled data.Ã Ã",IJCAI
Sets2Sets: Learning from Sequential Sets with Neural Networks,2019,"Given past sequential sets of elements, predicting the subsequent sets of elements is an important problem in different domains. With the past orders of customers given, predicting the items that are likely to be bought in their following orders can provide information about the future purchase intentions. With the past clinical records of patients at each visit to the hospitals given, predicting the future clinical records in the subsequent visits can provide information about the future disease progression. These useful information can help to make better decisions in different domains. However, existing methods have not studied this problem well. In this paper, we formulate this problem as a sequential sets to sequential sets learning problem. We propose an end-to-end learning approach based on an encoder-decoder framework to solve the problem. In the encoder, our approach maps the set of elements at each past time step into a vector. In the decoder, our method decodes the set of elements at each subsequent time step from the vectors with a set-based attention mechanism. The repeated elements pattern is also considered in our method to further improve the performance. In addition, our objective function addresses the imbalance and correlation existing among the predicted elements. The experimental results on three real-world data sets showthat our method outperforms the best performance of the compared methods with respect to recall and person-wise hit ratio by 2.7-20.6% and 2.1-26.3%, respectively. Our analysis also shows that our decoder has good generalization to output sequential sets that are even longer than the output of training instances.",KDD
Data-driven Automatic Treatment Regimen Development and Recommendation,2016,"The analysis of large-scale Electrical Medical Records (EMRs) has the potential to develop and optimize clinical treatment regimens. A treatment regimen usually includes a series of doctor orders containing rich temporal and heterogeneous information. However, in many existing studies, a doctor order is simplified as an event code and a treatment record is simplified as a code sequence. Thus, the information inherent in doctor orders is not fully used for in-depth analysis. In this paper, we aim at exploiting the rich information in doctor orders and developing data-driven approaches for improving clinical treatments. To this end, we first propose a novel method to measure the similarities between treatment records with consideration of sequential and multifaceted information in doctor orders. Then, we propose an efficient density-based clustering algorithm to summarize large-scale treatment records, and extract a semantic representation of each treatment cluster. Finally, we develop a unified framework to evaluate the discovered treatment regimens, and find the most effective treatment regimen for new patients. In the empirical study, we validate our methods with EMRs of 27,678 patients from 14 hospitals. The results show that: 1) Our method can successfully extract typical treatment regimens from large-scale treatment records. The extracted treatment regimens are intuitive and provide managerial implications for treatment regimen design and optimization. 2) By recommending the most effective treatment regimens, the total cure rate in our data improves from 19.89% to 21.28%, and the effective rate increases up to 98.29%.",KDD
Glaucoma Progression Prediction Using Retinal Thickness via Latent Space Linear Regression,2019,"Prediction of glaucomatous visual field loss has significant clinical benefits because it can help with early detection of glaucoma as well as decision-making for treatments. Glaucomatous visual loss is conventionally captured through visual field sensitivity (VF ) measurement, which is costly and time-consuming. Thus, existing approaches mainly predict future VF utilizing limited VF data collected in the past. Recently, optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been adopted to measure retinal layers thickness (RT ) for considerably more low-cost treatment assistance. There then arises an important question in the context of ophthalmology: are RT measurements beneficial for VF prediction? In this paper, we propose a novel method to demonstrate the benefits provided by RT measurements. The challenge is management of the two heterogeneities of VF data and RT data as RT data are collected according to different clinical schedules and lie in a different space to VF data. To tackle these heterogeneities, we propose latent progression patterns (LPPs), a novel type of representations for glaucoma progression. Along with LPPs, we propose a method to transform VF series to an LPP based on matrix factorization and a method to transform RT series to an LPP based on deep neural networks. Partial VF and RT information is integrated in LPPs to provide accurate prediction. The proposed framework is named deeply-regularized latent-space linear regression (\em DLLR). We empirically demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art technique by 12% for the best case in terms of the mean of the root mean square error on a real dataset.",KDD
Density-based logistic regression,2013,"This paper introduces a nonlinear logistic regression model for classification. The main idea is to map the data to a feature space based on kernel density estimation. A discriminative model is then learned to optimize the feature weights as well as the bandwidth of a Nadaraya-Watson kernel density estimator. We then propose a hierarchical optimization algorithm for learning the coefficients and kernel bandwidths in an integrated way. Compared to other nonlinear models such as kernel logistic regression (KLR) and SVM, our approach is far more efficient since it solves an optimization problem with a much smaller size. Two other major advantages are that it can cope with categorical attributes in a unified fashion and naturally handle multi-class problems. Moveover, our approach inherits from logistic regression good interpretability of the model, which is important for clinical applications but not offered by KLR and SVM. Extensive results on real datasets, including a clinical prediction application currently under deployment in a major hospital, show that our approach not only achieves superior classification accuracy, but also drastically reduces the computing time as compared to other leading methods.",KDD
On Whom Should I Perform this Lab Test Next? An Active Feature Elicitation Approach,2018,"We consider the problem of actively feature elicitation in which given a few examples with all the features (say the full EHR) and a few examples with some of the features (say demographics), the goal is to identify the set of examples on whom more informationÃâÃ (say the lab tests) needs to be collected. The observation is that some set of features may be more expensive, personal or cumbersome to collect. We propose an active learning approach which identifies examples that are dissimilar to the ones with the full set of data and acquire the complete set of features for these examples. Motivated by real clinical tasks, our extensive evaluation on three clinical tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.",IJCAI
Marble: high-throughput phenotyping from electronic health records via sparse nonnegative tensor factorization,2014,"The rapidly increasing availability of electronic health records (EHRs) from multiple heterogeneous sources has spearheaded the adoption of data-driven approaches for improved clinical research, decision making, prognosis, and patient management. Unfortunately, EHR data do not always directly and reliably map to phenotypes, or medical concepts, that clinical researchers need or use. Existing phenotyping approaches typically require labor intensive supervision from medical experts. We propose Marble, a novel sparse non-negative tensor factorization method to derive phenotype candidates with virtually no human supervision. Marble decomposes the observed tensor into two terms, a bias tensor and an interaction tensor. The bias tensor represents the baseline characteristics common amongst the overall population and the interaction tensor defines the phenotypes. We demonstrate the capability of our proposed model on both simulated and patient data from a publicly available clinical database. Our results show that Marble derived phenotypes provide at least a 42.8% reduction in the number of non-zero element and also retains predictive power for classification purposes. Furthermore, the resulting phenotypes and baseline characteristics from real EHR data are consistent with known characteristics of the patient population. Thus it can potentially be used to rapidly characterize, predict, and manage a large number of diseases, thereby promising a novel, data-driven solution that can benefit very large segments of the population.",KDD
Subspace Network: Deep Multi-Task Censored Regression for Modeling Neurodegenerative Diseases,2018,"Over the past decade a wide spectrum of machine learning models have been developed to model the neurodegenerative diseases, associating biomarkers, especially non-intrusive neuroimaging markers, with key clinical scores measuring the cognitive status of patients. Multi-task learning (MTL) has been commonly utilized by these studies to address high dimensionality and small cohort size challenges. However, most existing MTL approaches are based on linear models and suffer from two major limitations: 1) they cannot explicitly consider upper/lower bounds in these clinical scores; 2) they lack the capability to capture complicated non-linear interactions among the variables. In this paper, we propose Subspace Network, an efficient deep modeling approach for non-linear multi-task censored regression. Each layer of the subspace network performs a multi-task censored regression to improve upon the predictions from the last layer via sketching a low-dimensional subspace to perform knowledge transfer among learning tasks. Under mild assumptions, for each layer the parametric subspace can be recovered using only one pass of training data. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed subspace network quickly picks up the correct parameter subspaces, and outperforms state-of-the-arts in predicting neurodegenerative clinical scores using information in brain imaging.",KDD
Towards heterogeneous temporal clinical event pattern discovery: a convolutional approach,2012,"Large collections of electronic clinical records today provide us with a vast source of information on medical practice. However, the utilization of those data for exploratory analysis to support clinical decisions is still limited. Extracting useful patterns from such data is particularly challenging because it is longitudinal, sparse and heterogeneous. In this paper, we propose a Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) based framework using a convolutional approach for open-ended temporal pattern discovery over large collections of clinical records. We call the method One-Sided Convolutional NMF (OSC-NMF). Our framework can mine common as well as individual shift-invariant temporal patterns from heterogeneous events over different patient groups, and handle sparsity as well as scalability problems well. Furthermore, we use an event matrix based representation that can encode quantitatively all key temporal concepts including order, concurrency and synchronicity. We derive efficient multiplicative update rules for OSC-NMF, and also prove theoretically its convergence. Finally, the experimental results on both synthetic and real world electronic patient data are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",KDD
MNN: Multimodal Attentional Neural Networks for Diagnosis Prediction,2019,"Diagnosis prediction plays a key role in clinical decision supporting process, which attracted extensive research attention recently. Existing studies mainly utilize discrete medical codes (e.g., the ICD codes and procedure codes) as the primary features in prediction. However, in real clinical settings, such medical codes could be either incomplete or erroneous. For example, missed diagnosis will neglect some codes which should be included, mis-diagnosis will generate incorrect medical codes. To increase the robustness towards noisy data, we introduce textual clinical notes in addition to medical codes. Combining information from both sides will lead to improved understanding towards clinical health conditions. To accommodate both the textual notes and discrete medical codes in the same framework, we propose Multimodal Attentional Neural Networks (MNN), which integrates multi-modal data in a collaborative manner. Experimental results on real world EHR datasets demonstrate the advantages of MNN in terms of both robustness and accuracy.",IJCAI
Text Mining in Clinical Domain: Dealing with Noise,2016,"Text mining in clinical domain is usually more difficult than general domains (e.g. newswire reports and scientific literature) because of the high level of noise in both the corpus and training data for machine learning (ML). A large number of unknown word, non-word and poor grammatical sentences made up the noise in the clinical corpus. Unknown words are usually complex medical vocabularies, misspellings, acronyms and abbreviations where unknown non-words are generally the clinical patterns including scores and measures. This noise produces obstacles in the initial lexical processing step as well as subsequent semantic analysis. Furthermore, the labelled data used to build ML models is very costly to obtain because it requires intensive clinical knowledge from the annotators. And even created by experts, the training examples usually contain errors and inconsistencies due to the variations in human annotators' attentiveness. Clinical domain also suffers from the nature of the imbalanced data distribution problem. These kinds of noise are very popular and potentially affect the overall information extraction performance but they were not carefully investigated in most presented health informatics systems. This paper introduces a general clinical data mining architecture which is potential of addressing all of these challenges using: automatic proof-reading process, trainable finite state pattern recogniser, iterative model development and active learning. The reportability classifier based on this architecture achieved 98.25% sensitivity and 96.14% specificity on an Australian cancer registry's held-out test set and up to 92% of training data provided for supervised ML was saved by active learning.",KDD
Learning Adaptive Forecasting Models from Irregularly Sampled Multivariate Clinical Data,2016,"Building accurate predictive models of clinical multivariate time series is crucial for understanding of the patient condition, the dynamics of a disease, and clinical decision making. A challenging aspect of this process is that the model should be flexible and adaptive to reflect well patient-specific temporal behaviors and this also in the case when the available patient-specific data are sparse and short span. To address this problem we propose and develop an adaptive two-stage forecasting approach for modeling multivariate, irregularly sampled clinical time series of varying lengths. The proposed model (1) learns the population trend from a collection of time series for past patients; (2) captures individual-specific short-term multivariate variability; and (3) adapts by automatically adjusting its predictions based on new observations. The proposed forecasting model is evaluated on a real-world clinical time series dataset. The results demonstrate that our approach is superior on the prediction tasks for multivariate, irregularly sampled clinical time series, and it outperforms both the population based and patient-specific time series prediction models in terms of prediction accuracy.",AAAI
SympGraph: a framework for mining clinical notes through symptom relation graphs,2012,"As an integral part of Electronic Health Records (EHRs), clinical notes pose special challenges for analyzing EHRs due to their unstructured nature. In this paper, we present a general mining framework SympGraph for modeling and analyzing symptom relationships in clinical notes.
 A SympGraph has symptoms as nodes and co-occurrence relations between symptoms as edges, and can be constructed automatically through extracting symptoms over sequences of clinical notes for a large number of patients. We present an important clinical application of SympGraph: symptom expansion, which can expand a given set of symptoms to other related symptoms by analyzing the underlying SympGraph structure. We further propose a matrix update algorithm which provides a significant computational saving for dynamic updates to the graph. Comprehensive evaluation on 1 million longitudinal clinical notes over 13K patients shows that static symptom expansion can successfully expand a set of known symptoms to a disease with high agreement rate with physician input (average precision 0.46), a 31% improvement over baseline co-occurrence based methods. The experimental results also show that the expanded symptoms can serve as useful features for improving AUC measure for disease diagnosis prediction, thus confirming the potential clinical value of our work.",KDD
Designing efficient cascaded classifiers: tradeoff between accuracy and cost,2010,"We propose a method to train a cascade of classifiers by simultaneously optimizing all its stages. The approach relies on the idea of optimizing soft cascades. In particular, instead of optimizing a deterministic hard cascade, we optimize a stochastic soft cascade where each stage accepts or rejects samples according to a probability distribution induced by the previous stage-specific classifier. The overall system accuracy is maximized while explicitly controlling the expected cost for feature acquisition. Experimental results on three clinically relevant problems show the effectiveness of our proposed approach in achieving the desired tradeoff between accuracy and feature acquisition cost.",KDD
Learning Phenotypes and Dynamic Patient Representations via RNN Regularized Collective Non-Negative Tensor Factorization,2019,"Non-negative Tensor Factorization (NTF) has been shown effective to discover clinically relevant and interpretable phenotypes from Electronic Health Records (EHR). Existing NTF based computational phenotyping models aggregate data over the observation window, resulting in the learned phenotypes being mixtures of disease states appearing at different times. We argue that by separating the clinical events happening at different times in the input tensor, the temporal dynamics and the disease progression within the observation window could be modeled and the learned phenotypes will correspond to more specific disease states. Yet how to construct the tensor for data samples with different temporal lengths and properly capture the temporal relationship specific to each individual data sample remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel Collective Non-negative Tensor Factorization (CNTF) model where each patient is represented by a temporal tensor, and all of the temporal tensors are factorized collectively with the phenotype definitions being shared across all patients. The proposed CNTF model is also flexible to incorporate non-temporal data modality and RNN-based temporal regularization. We validate the proposed model using MIMIC-III dataset, and the empirical results show that the learned phenotypes are clinically interpretable. Moreover, the proposed CNTF model outperforms the state-of-the-art computational phenotyping models for the mortality prediction task.",AAAI
Detecting Devastating Diseases in Search Logs,2016,"Web search queries can offer a unique population-scale window onto streams of evidence that are useful for detecting the emergence of health conditions. We explore the promise of harnessing behavioral signals in search logs to provide advance warning about the presence of devastating diseases such as pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is often diagnosed too late to be treated effectively as the cancer has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. Symptoms of the early stages of the illness are often subtle and nonspecific. We identify searchers who issue credible, first-person diagnostic queries for pancreatic cancer and we learn models from prior search histories that predict which searchers will later input such queries. We show that we can infer the likelihood of seeing the rise of diagnostic queries months before they appear and characterize the tradeoff between predictivity and false positive rate. The findings highlight the potential of harnessing search logs for the early detection of pancreatic cancer and more generally for harnessing search systems to reduce health risks for individuals.",KDD

Estimating Glaucomatous Visual Sensitivity from Retinal Thickness with Pattern-Based Regularization and Visualization,2018,"Conventionally, glaucoma is diagnosed on the basis of visual field sensitivity (VF). However, the VF test is time-consuming, costly, and noisy. Using retinal thickness (RT) for glaucoma diagnosis is currently desirable. Thus, we propose a new methodology for estimating VF from RT in glaucomatous eyes. The key ideas are to use our new methods of pattern-based regularization (PBR) and pattern-based visualization (PBV) with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). PBR effectively conducts supervised learning of RT-VF relations in combination with unsupervised learning from non-paired VF data. We can thereby avoid overfitting of a CNN to small sized data. PBV visualizes functional correspondence between RT and VF with its nonlinearity preserved. We empirically demonstrate with real datasets that a CNN with PBR achieves the highest estimation accuracy to date and that a CNN with PBV is effective for knowledge discovery in an ophthalmological context.",KDD
Probabilistic Graphical Models of Dyslexia,2015,"Reading is a complex cognitive process, errors in which may assume diverse forms. In this study, introducing a novel approach, we use two families of probabilistic graphical models to analyze patterns of reading errors made by dyslexic people: an LDA-based model and two NaÃÂ«ve Bayes models which differ by their assumptions about the generation process of reading errors. The models are trained on a large corpus of reading errors. Results show that a NaÃÂ«ve Bayes model achieves highest accuracy compared to labels given by clinicians (AUC = 0.801 ÃÂ± 0.05), thus providing the first automated and objective diagnosis tool for dyslexia which is solely based on reading errors data. Results also show that the LDA-based model best captures patterns of reading errors and could therefore contribute to the understanding of dyslexia and to future improvement of the diagnostic procedure. Finally, we draw on our results to shed light on a theoretical debate about the definition and heterogeneity of dyslexia. Our results support a model assuming multiple dyslexia subtypes, that of a heterogeneous view of dyslexia.",KDD
Stable Feature Selection from Brain sMRI,2015,"Neuroimage analysis usually involves learning thousands or even millions of variables using only a limited number of samples. In this regard, sparse models, e.g. the lasso, are applied to select the optimal features and achieve high diagnosis accuracy. The lasso, however, usually results in independent unstable features. Stability, a manifest of reproducibility of statistical results subject to reasonable perturbations to data and the model (Yu 2013), is an important focus in statistics, especially in the analysis of high dimensional data. In this paper, we explore a nonnegative generalized fused lasso model for stable feature selection in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. In addition to sparsity, our model incorporates two important pathological priors: the spatial cohesion of lesion voxels and the positive correlation between the features and the disease labels. To optimize the model, we propose an efficient algorithm by proving a novel link between total variation and fast network flow algorithms via conic duality. Experiments show that the proposed nonnegative model performs much better in exploring the intrinsic structure of data via selecting stable features compared with other state-of-the-arts.",AAAI
Sparse Bayesian Multiview Learning for Simultaneous Association Discovery and Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease,2015,"In the analysis and diagnosis of many diseases, such as the Alzheimer's disease (AD), two important and related tasks are usually required: i) selecting genetic and phenotypical markers for diagnosis, and ii) identifying associations between genetic and phenotypical features. While previous studies treat these two tasks separately, they are tightly coupled due to the same underlying biological basis. To harness their potential benefits for each other, we propose a new sparse Bayesian approach to jointly carry out the two important and related tasks. In our approach, we extract common latent features from different data sources by sparse projection matrices and then use the latent features to predict disease severity levels; in return, the disease status can guide the learning of sparse projection matrices, which not only reveal interactions between data sources but also select groups of related biomarkers. In order to boost the learning of sparse projection matrices, we further incorporate graph Laplacian priors encoding the valuable linkage disequilibrium (LD) information. To efficiently estimate the model, we develop a variational inference algorithm. Analysis on an imaging genetics dataset for AD study shows that our model discovers biologically meaningful associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features, and achieves significantly higher accuracy for predicting ordinal AD stages than competitive methods.",AAAI
G2C: A Generator-to-Classifier Framework Integrating Multi-Stained Visual Cues for Pathological Glomerulus Classification,2019,"Pathological glomerulus classification plays a key role in the diagnosis of nephropathy. As the difference between different subcategories is subtle, doctors often refer to slides from different staining methods to make decisions. However, creating correspondence across various stains is labor-intensive, bringing major difficulties in collecting data and training a vision-based algorithm to assist nephropathy diagnosis.",AAAI
Functional Connectivity Network Analysis with Discriminative Hub Detection for Brain Disease Identification,2019,"Brain network analysis can help reveal the pathological basis of neurological disorders and facilitate automated diagnosis of brain diseases, by exploring connectivity patterns in the human brain. Effectively representing the brain network has always been the fundamental task of computeraided brain network analysis. Previous studies typically utilize human-engineered features to represent brain connectivity networks, but these features may not be well coordinated with subsequent classifiers. Besides, brain networks are often equipped with multiple hubs (i.e., nodes occupying a central position in the overall organization of a network), providing essential clues to describe connectivity patterns. However, existing studies often fail to explore such hubs from brain connectivity networks. To address these two issues, we propose a Connectivity Network analysis method with discriminative Hub Detection (CNHD) for brain disease diagnosis using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Specifically, we incorporate both feature extraction of brain networks and network-based classification into a unified model, while discriminative hubs can be automatically identified from data via Ã¢ââ1-norm and Ã¢ââ2,1-norm regularizers. The proposed CNHD method is evaluated on three real-world schizophrenia datasets with fMRI scans. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in disease diagnosis, but also is effective in automatically identifying disease-related network hubs in the human brain.",AAAI
Weakly-Supervised Simultaneous Evidence Identification and Segmentation for Automated Glaucoma Diagnosis,2019,"Evidence identification, optic disc segmentation and automated glaucoma diagnosis are the most clinically significant tasks for clinicians to assess fundus images. However, delivering the three tasks simultaneously is extremely challenging due to the high variability of fundus structure and lack of datasets with complete annotations. In this paper, we propose an innovative Weakly-Supervised Multi-Task Learning method (WSMTL) for accurate evidence identification, optic disc segmentation and automated glaucoma diagnosis. The WSMTL method only uses weak-label data with binary diagnostic labels (normal/glaucoma) for training, while obtains pixel-level segmentation mask and diagnosis for testing. The WSMTL is constituted by a skip and densely connected CNN to capture multi-scale discriminative representation of fundus structure; a well-designed pyramid integration structure to generate high-resolution evidence map for evidence identification, in which the pixels with higher value represent higher confidence to highlight the abnormalities; a constrained clustering branch for optic disc segmentation; and a fully-connected discriminator for automated glaucoma diagnosis. Experimental results show that our proposed WSMTL effectively and simultaneously delivers evidence identification, optic disc segmentation (89.6% TP Dice), and accurate glaucoma diagnosis (92.4% AUC). This endows our WSMTL a great potential for the effective clinical assessment of glaucoma.",AAAI
An integrated machine learning approach to stroke prediction,2010,"Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the principal cause of serious long-term disability in the United States. Accurate prediction of stroke is highly valuable for early intervention and treatment. In this study, we compare the Cox proportional hazards model with a machine learning approach for stroke prediction on the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) dataset. Specifically, we consider the common problems of data imputation, feature selection, and prediction in medical datasets. We propose a novel automatic feature selection algorithm that selects robust features based on our proposed heuristic: conservative mean. Combined with Support Vector Machines (SVMs), our proposed feature selection algorithm achieves a greater area under the ROC curve (AUC) as compared to the Cox proportional hazards model and L1 regularized Cox feature selection algorithm. Furthermore, we present a margin-based censored regression algorithm that combines the concept of margin-based classifiers with censored regression to achieve a better concordance index than the Cox model. Overall, our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art in both metrics of AUC and concordance index. In addition, our work has also identified potential risk factors that have not been discovered by traditional approaches. Our method can be applied to clinical prediction of other diseases, where missing data are common and risk factors are not well understood.",KDD
Feature Isolation for Hypothesis Testing in Retinal Imaging: An Ischemic Stroke Prediction Case Study,2019,"Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and long-term disability that is difficult to predict reliably. Retinal fundus photography has been proposed for stroke risk assessment, due to its non-invasiveness and the similarity between retinal and cerebral microcirculations, with past studies claiming a correlation between venular caliber and stroke risk. However, it may be that other retinal features are more appropriate. In this paper, extensive experiments with deep learning on six retinal datasets are described. Feature isolation involving segmented vascular tree images is applied to establish the effectiveness of vessel caliber and shape alone for stroke classification, and dataset ablation is applied to investigate model generalizability on unseen sources. The results suggest that vessel caliber and shape could be indicative of ischemic stroke, and sourcespecific features could influence model performance.",AAAI
Batch Model for Batched Timestamps Data Analysis with Application to the SSA Disability Program,2016,"The Office of Disability Adjudication and Review (ODAR) is responsible for holding hearings, issuing decisions, and reviewing appeals as part of the Social Security Administration's disability determining process. In order to control and process cases, the ODAR has established a Case Processing and Management System (CPMS) to record management information since December 2003. The CPMS provides a detailed case status history for each case. Due to the large number of appeal requests and limited resources, the number of pending claims at ODAR was over one million cases by March 31, 2015. Our National Institutes of Health (NIH) team collaborated with SSA and developed a Case Status Change Model (CSCM) project to meet the ODAR's urgent need of reducing backlogs and improve hearings and appeals process. One of the key issues in our CSCM project is to estimate the expected service time and its variation for each case status code. The challenge is that the system's recorded job departure times may not be the true job finished times. As the CPMS timestamps data of case status codes showed apparent batch patterns, we proposed a batch model and applied the constrained least squares method to estimate the mean service times and the variances. We also proposed a batch search algorithm to determine the optimal batch partition, as no batch partition was given in the real data. Simulation studies were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods. Finally, we applied the method to analyze a real CPMS data from ODAR/SSA.",KDD
Early Prediction of Diabetes Complications from Electronic Health Records: A Multi-Task Survival Analysis Approach,2018,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disease that usually results in multiple complications. Early identification of individuals at risk for complications after being diagnosed with T2DM is of significant clinical value. In this paper, we present a new data-driven predictive approach to predict when a patient will develop complications after the initial T2DM diagnosis. We propose a novel survival analysis method to model the time-to-event of T2DM complications designed to simultaneously achieve two important metrics: 1) accurate prediction of event times, and 2) good ranking of the relative risks of two patients. Moreover, to better capture the correlations of time-to-events of the multiple complications, we further develop a multi-task version of the survival model. To assess the performance of these approaches, we perform extensive experiments on patient level data extracted from a large electronic health record claims database. The results show that our new proposed survival analysis approach consistently outperforms traditional survival models and demonstrate the effectiveness of the multi-task framework over modeling each complication independently.",AAAI
Concepts-Bridges: Uncovering Conceptual Bridges Based on Biomedical Concept Evolution,2018,"Given two topics of interest (A, C) that are otherwise disconnected - for instance two concepts: a disease (""Migraine"") and a therapeutic substance (""Magnesium"") - this paper attempts to find the conceptual bridges (e.g., serotonin (B)) that connects them in a novel way. This problem of mining implicit linkage is known as hypotheses generation and its potential to accelerate scientific progress is widely recognized. Almost all of the prior studies to tackle this problem ignore the temporal dynamics of concepts. This is limiting because it is known that the semantic meaning of a concept evolves over time. To overcome this issue, in this study, we define this problem as mining time-aware Top-k conceptual bridges, and in doing so provide a systematic approach to formalize the problem. Specifically, the proposed model first extracts relevant entities from the corpus, represents them in time-specific latent spaces, and then further reasons upon it to generate novel and experimentally testable hypotheses. The key challenge in this approach is to learn a mapping function that encodes the temporal characteristics of concepts and aligns the across-time latent spaces. To solve this, we propose an effective algorithm that learns precise mapping sensitive to both global and local semantics of the input query. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations performed on the largest available biomedical corpus substantiate the importance of leveraging the evolutionary semantics of medical concepts and suggests that the generated hypotheses are novel and worthy of clinical trials.",KDD
Benefits of bias: towards better characterization of network sampling,2011,"From social networks to P2P systems, network sampling arises in many settings. We present a detailed study on the nature of biases in network sampling strategies to shed light on how best to sample from networks. We investigate connections between specific biases and various measures of structural representativeness. We show that certain biases are, in fact, beneficial for many applications, as they ""push"" the sampling process towards inclusion of desired properties. Finally, we describe how these sampling biases can be exploited in several, real-world applications including disease outbreak detection and market research.",KDD
Modeling Precursors for Event Forecasting via Nested Multi-Instance Learning,2016,"Forecasting large-scale societal events like civil unrest movements, disease outbreaks, and elections is an important and challenging problem. From the perspective of human analysts and policy makers, forecasting algorithms must not only make accurate predictions but must also provide supporting evidence, e.g., the causal factors related to the event of interest. We develop a novel multiple instance learning based approach that jointly tackles the problem of identifying evidence-based precursors and forecasts events into the future. Specifically, given a collection of streaming news articles from multiple sources we develop a nested multiple instance learning approach to forecast significant societal events such as protests. Using data from three countries in Latin America, we demonstrate how our approach is able to consistently identify news articles considered as precursors for protests. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the strengths of our proposed approach in filtering candidate precursors, in forecasting the occurrence of events with a lead time advantage and in accurately predicting the characteristics of civil unrest events.",KDD
Learning Temporal State of Diabetes Patients via Combining Behavioral and Demographic Data,2017,"Diabetes is a serious disease affecting a large number of people. Although there is no cure for diabetes, it can be managed. Especially, with advances in sensor technology, lots of data may lead to the improvement of diabetes management, if properly mined. However, there usually exists noise or errors in the observed behavioral data which poses challenges in extracting meaningful knowledge. To overcome this challenge, we learn the latent state which represents the patient's condition. Such states should be inferred from the behavioral data but unknown a priori. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to capture the trajectory of latent states for patients from behavioral data while exploiting their demographic differences and similarities to other patients. We conduct a hypothesis test to illustrate the importance of the demographic data in diabetes management, and validate that each behavioral feature follows an exponential or a Gaussian distribution. Integrating these aspects, we use a Demographic feature restricted hidden Markov model (DfrHMM) to estimate the trajectory of latent states by integrating the demographic and behavioral data. In DfrHMM, the latent state is mainly determined by the previous state and the demographic features in a nonlinear way. Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques are used for model parameter estimation. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that DfrHMM is effective in diabetes management.",KDD
A Spatially Sensitive Kernel to Predict Cognitive Performance from Short-Term Changes in Neural Structure,2014,"This paper introduces a novel framework for performing machine learning onlongitudinal neuroimaging datasets. These datasets are characterized by theirsize, particularly their width (millions of features per data input). Specifically, we address the problem of detecting subtle, short-term changes inneural structure that are indicative of cognitive change and correlate withrisk factors for Alzheimer's disease. We introduce a new spatially-sensitivekernel that allows us to reason about individuals, as opposed to populations. In doing so, this paper presents the first evidence demonstrating that verysmall changes in white matter structure over a two year period can predictchange in cognitive function in healthy adults.",AAAI
CoupledLP: Link Prediction in Coupled Networks,2015,"We study the problem of link prediction in coupled networks, where we have the structure information of one (source) network and the interactions between this network and another (target) network. The goal is to predict the missing links in the target network. The problem is extremely challenging as we do not have any information of the target network. Moreover, the source and target networks are usually heterogeneous and have different types of nodes and links. How to utilize the structure information in the source network for predicting links in the target network? How to leverage the heterogeneous interactions between the two networks for the prediction task?
 We propose a unified framework, CoupledLP, to solve the problem. Given two coupled networks, we first leverage atomic propagation rules to automatically construct implicit links in the target network for addressing the challenge of target network incompleteness, and then propose a coupled factor graph model to incorporate the meta-paths extracted from the coupled part of the two networks for transferring heterogeneous knowledge. We evaluate the proposed framework on two different genres of datasets: disease-gene (DG) and mobile social networks. In the DG networks, we aim to use the disease network to predict the associations between genes. In the mobile networks, we aim to use the mobile communication network of one mobile operator to infer the network structure of its competitors. On both datasets, the proposed CoupledLP framework outperforms several alternative methods. The proposed problem of coupled link prediction and the corresponding framework demonstrate both the scientific and business applications in biology and social networks.",KDD
Inside the atoms: ranking on a network of networks,2014,"Networks are prevalent and have posed many fascinating research questions. How can we spot similar users, e.g., virtual identical twins, in Cleveland for a New Yorker? Given a query disease, how can we prioritize its candidate genes by incorporating the tissue-specific protein interaction networks of those similar diseases? In most, if not all, of the existing network ranking methods, the nodes are the ranking objects with the finest granularity. In this paper, we propose a new network data model, a Network of Networks (NoN), where each node of the main network itself can be further represented as another (domain-specific) network. This new data model enables to compare the nodes in a broader context and rank them at a finer granularity. Moreover, such an NoN model enables much more efficient search when the ranking targets reside in a certain domain-specific network. We formulate ranking on NoN as a regularized optimization problem; propose efficient algorithms and provide theoretical analysis, such as optimality, convergence, complexity and equivalence. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of our methods.",KDD
Predicting Alzheimer's Disease Cognitive Assessment via Robust Low-Rank Structured Sparse Model,2017,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with slow onset, which could result in the deterioration of the duration of persistent neurological dysfunction. How to identify the informative longitudinal phenotypic neuroimaging markers and predict cognitive measures are crucial to recognize AD at early stage. Many existing models related imaging measures to cognitive status using regression models, but they did not take full consideration of the interaction between cognitive scores. In this paper, we propose a robust low-rank structured sparse regression method (RLSR) to address this issue. The proposed model simultaneously selects effective features and learns the underlying structure between cognitive scores by utilizing novel mixed structured sparsity inducing norms and low-rank approximation. In addition, an efficient algorithm is derived to solve the proposed non-smooth objective function with proved convergence. Empirical studies on cognitive data of the ADNI cohort demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.",IJCAI
Spatially regularized logistic regression for disease mapping on large moving populations,2011,"Spatial analysis of disease risk, or disease mapping, typically relies on information about the residence and health status of individuals from population under study. However, residence information has its limitations because people are exposed to numerous disease risks as they spend time outside of their residences. Thanks to the wide-spread use of mobile phones and GPS-enabled devices, it is becoming possible to obtain a detailed record about the movement of human populations. Availability of movement information opens up an opportunity to improve the accuracy of disease mapping. Starting with an assumption that an individual's disease risk is a weighted average of risks at the locations which were visited, we show that disease mapping can be accomplished by spatially regularized logistic regression. Due to the inherent sparsity of movement data, the proposed approach can be applied to large populations and over large spatial grids. In our experiments, we were able to map disease for a simulated population with 1.6 million people and a spatial grid with 65 thousand locations in several minutes. The results indicate that movement information can improve the accuracy of disease mapping as compared to residential data only. We also studied a privacy-preserving scenario in which only the aggregate statistics are available about the movement of the overall population, while detailed movement information is available only for individuals with disease. The results indicate that the accuracy of disease mapping remains satisfactory when learning from movement data sanitized in this way.",KDD
Brain effective connectivity modeling for alzheimer's disease by sparse gaussian bayesian network,2011,"Recent studies have shown that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is related to alteration in brain connectivity networks. One type of connectivity, called effective connectivity, defined as the directional relationship between brain regions, is essential to brain function. However, there have been few studies on modeling the effective connectivity of AD and characterizing its difference from normal controls (NC). In this paper, we investigate the sparse Bayesian Network (BN) for effective connectivity modeling. Specifically, we propose a novel formulation for the structure learning of BNs, which involves one L1-norm penalty term to impose sparsity and another penalty to ensure the learned BN to be a directed acyclic graph - a required property of BNs. We show, through both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on eleven moderate and large benchmark networks with various sample sizes, that the proposed method has much improved learning accuracy and scalability compared with ten competing algorithms. We apply the proposed method to FDG-PET images of 42 AD and 67 NC subjects, and identify the effective connectivity models for AD and NC, respectively. Our study reveals that the effective connectivity of AD is different from that of NC in many ways, including the global-scale effective connectivity, intra-lobe, inter-lobe, and inter-hemispheric effective connectivity distributions, as well as the effective connectivity associated with specific brain regions. These findings are consistent with known pathology and clinical progression of AD, and will contribute to AD knowledge discovery.",KDD
PD Disease State Assessment in Naturalistic Environments Using Deep Learning,2015,"Management of Parkinson's Disease (PD) could be improved significantly if reliable, objective information about fluctuations in disease severity can be obtained in ecologically valid surroundings such as the private home. Although automatic assessment in PD has been studied extensively, so far no approach has been devised that is useful for clinical practice. Analysis approaches common for the field lack the capability of exploiting data from realistic environments, which represents a major barrier towards practical assessment systems. The very unreliable and infrequent labelling of ambiguous, low resolution movement data collected in such environments represents a very challenging analysis setting, where advances would have significant societal impact in our ageing population. In this work we propose an assessment system that abides practical usability constraints and applies deep learning to differentiate disease state in data collected in naturalistic settings. Based on a large data-set collected from 34 people with PD we illustrate that deep learning outperforms other approaches in generalisation performance, despite the unreliable labelling characteristic for this problem setting, and how such systems could improve current clinical practice.",AAAI
Multi-View Multi-Graph Embedding for Brain Network Clustering Analysis,2018,"Network analysis of human brain connectivity is critically important for understanding brain function and disease states. Embedding a brain network as a whole graph instance into a meaningful low-dimensional representation can be used to investigate disease mechanisms and inform therapeutic interventions. Moreover, by exploiting information from multiple neuroimaging modalities or views, we are able to obtain an embedding that is more useful than the embedding learned from an individual view. Therefore, multi-view multi-graph embedding becomes a crucial task. Currently only a few studies have been devoted to this topic, and most of them focus on vector-based strategy which will cause structural information contained in the original graphs lost. As a novel attempt to tackle this problem, we propose Multi-view Multi-graph Embedding M2E by stacking multi-graphs into multiple partially-symmetric tensors and using tensor techniques to simultaneously leverage the dependencies and correlations among multi-view and multi-graph brain networks. Extensive experiments on real HIV and bipolar disorder brain network datasets demonstrate the superior performance of M2E on clustering brain networks by leveraging the multi-view multi-graph interactions.",AAAI
Hybrid Approach of Relation Network and Localized Graph Convolutional Filtering for Breast Cancer Subtype Classification,2018,"Network biology has been successfully used to help reveal complex mechanisms of disease, especially cancer. On the other hand, network biology requires in-depth knowledge to construct disease-specific networks, but our current knowledge is very limited even with the recent advances in human cancer biology. Deep learning has shown an ability to address the problem like this. However, it conventionally used grid-like structured data, thus application of deep learning technologies to the human disease subtypes is yet to be explored. To overcome the issue, we propose a hybrid model, which integrates two key components 1) graph convolution neural network (graph CNN) and 2) relation network (RN). Experimental results on synthetic data and breast cancer data demonstrate that our proposed method shows better performances than existing methods.",IJCAI
A multi-task learning formulation for predicting disease progression,2011,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the most common type of dementia, is a severe neurodegenerative disorder. Identifying markers that can track the progress of the disease has recently received increasing attentions in AD research. A definitive diagnosis of AD requires autopsy confirmation, thus many clinical/cognitive measures including Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) have been designed to evaluate the cognitive status of the patients and used as important criteria for clinical diagnosis of probable AD. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning formulation for predicting the disease progression measured by the cognitive scores and selecting markers predictive of the progression. Specifically, we formulate the prediction problem as a multi-task regression problem by considering the prediction at each time point as a task. We capture the intrinsic relatedness among different tasks by a temporal group Lasso regularizer. The regularizer consists of two components including an L2,1-norm penalty on the regression weight vectors, which ensures that a small subset of features will be selected for the regression models at all time points, and a temporal smoothness term which ensures a small deviation between two regression models at successive time points. We have performed extensive evaluations using various types of data at the baseline from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database for predicting the future MMSE and ADAS-Cog scores. Our experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for capturing the progression trend and the cross-sectional group differences of AD severity. Results also show that most markers selected by the proposed algorithm are consistent with findings from existing cross-sectional studies.",KDD
FUNNEL: automatic mining of spatially coevolving epidemics,2014,"Given a large collection of epidemiological data consisting of the count of d contagious diseases for l locations of duration n, how can we find patterns, rules and outliers? For example, the Project Tycho provides open access to the count infections for U.S. states from 1888 to 2013, for 56 contagious diseases (e.g., measles, influenza), which include missing values, possible recording errors, sudden spikes (or dives) of infections, etc. So how can we find a combined model, for all these diseases, locations, and time-ticks? In this paper, we present FUNNEL, a unifying analytical model for large scale epidemiological data, as well as a novel fitting algorithm, FUNNELFIT, which solves the above problem. Our method has the following properties: (a) Sense-making: it detects important patterns of epidemics, such as periodicities, the appearance of vaccines, external shock events, and more; (b) Parameter-free: our modeling framework frees the user from providing parameter values; (c) Scalable: FUNNELFIT is carefully designed to be linear on the input size; (d) General: our model is general and practical, which can be applied to various types of epidemics, including computer-virus propagation, as well as human diseases. Extensive experiments on real data demonstrate that FUNNELFIT does indeed discover important properties of epidemics: (P1) disease seasonality, e.g., influenza spikes in January, Lyme disease spikes in July and the absence of yearly periodicity for gonorrhea; (P2) disease reduction effect, e.g., the appearance of vaccines; (P3) local/state-level sensitivity, e.g., many measles cases in NY; (P4) external shock events, e.g., historical flu pandemics; (P5) detect incongruous values, i.e., data reporting errors.",KDD
PhoneMD: Learning to Diagnose Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease from Smartphone Data,2019,"ParkinsonÃ¢â¬â¢s disease is a neurodegenerative disease that can affect a personÃ¢â¬â¢s movement, speech, dexterity, and cognition. Clinicians primarily diagnose ParkinsonÃ¢â¬â¢s disease by performing a clinical assessment of symptoms. However, misdiagnoses are common. One factor that contributes to misdiagnoses is that the symptoms of ParkinsonÃ¢â¬â¢s disease may not be prominent at the time the clinical assessment is performed. Here, we present a machine-learning approach towards distinguishing between people with and without ParkinsonÃ¢â¬â¢s disease using long-term data from smartphone-based walking, voice, tapping and memory tests. We demonstrate that our attentive deep-learning models achieve significant improvements in predictive performance over strong baselines (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.85) in data from a cohort of 1853 participants. We also show that our models identify meaningful features in the input data. Our results confirm that smartphone data collected over extended periods of time could in the future potentially be used as a digital biomarker for the diagnosis of ParkinsonÃ¢â¬â¢s disease.",AAAI
SDREGION: Fast Spotting of Changing Communities in Biological Networks,2018,"Given a large, dynamic graph, how can we trace the activities of groups of vertices over time? Given a dynamic biological graph modeling a given disease progression, which genes interact closely at the early stage of the disease, and their interactions are being disrupted in the latter stage of the disease? Which genes interact sparsely at the early stage of the disease, and their interactions increase as the disease progresses? Knowing the answers to these questions is important as they give insights to the underlying molecular mechanism to disease progression, and potential treatments that target these mechanisms can be developed. There are three main contributions to this paper. First, we designed a novel algorithm, SDREGION, that identifies subgraphs that decrease or increase in density monotonically over time, referred to as d-regions or i-regions, respectively. We introduced the objective function, -density, for identifying d-(i-)regions. Second, SDREGION is a generic algorithm, applicable across several real datasets. In this manuscript, we showed its effectiveness, and made observations in the modeling of the progression of lung cancer. In particular, we observed that SDREGION identified d-(i-)regions that capture mechanisms that align with literature. Importantly, findings that were identified but were not retrospectively validated by literature may provide novel mechanisms in tumor progression that will guide future biological experiments. Third, SDREGION is scalable with a time complexity of O(mlogn + nlogn) where m is the number of edges, and n is the number of vertices in a given dynamic graph.",KDD
Modeling disease progression via fused sparse group lasso,2012,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder associated with aging. Understanding how the disease progresses and identifying related pathological biomarkers for the progression is of primary importance in Alzheimer's disease research. In this paper, we develop novel multi-task learning techniques to predict the disease progression measured by cognitive scores and select biomarkers predictive of the progression. In multi-task learning, the prediction of cognitive scores at each time point is considered as a task, and multiple prediction tasks at different time points are performed simultaneously to capture the temporal smoothness of the prediction models across different time points. Specifically, we propose a novel convex fused sparse group Lasso (cFSGL) formulation that allows the simultaneous selection of a common set of biomarkers for multiple time points and specific sets of biomarkers for different time points using the sparse group Lasso penalty and in the meantime incorporates the temporal smoothness using the fused Lasso penalty. The proposed formulation is challenging to solve due to the use of several non-smooth penalties. We show that the proximal operator associated with the proposed formulation exhibits a certain decomposition property and can be computed efficiently; thus cFSGL can be solved efficiently using the accelerated gradient method. To further improve the model, we propose two non-convex formulations to reduce the shrinkage bias inherent in the convex formulation. We employ the difference of convex programming technique to solve the non-convex formulations. Our extensive experiments using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed progression models in comparison with existing methods for disease progression. We also perform longitudinal stability selection to identify and analyze the temporal patterns of biomarkers in disease progression.",KDD
Cost-Sensitive Risk Stratification in the Diagnosis of Heart Disease,2012,"We investigate machine learning methods for diagnostic screening of heart disease. Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death in the US, causing more deaths than all types of cancers combined. Early diagnosis of heart disease in women is harder than it is in men and typically requires the administration of several clinical tests on the patient. Most risk stratification methods aggregate the results of such tests, including the risky, invasive procedures that cannot be administered on all patients. In this paper, our goal is to identify patients who are under high-risk of having heart disease and related adverse events, using a minimal number of diagnostic tests, especially less invasive ones. The low frequency of patients with severe heart disease in the dataset is challenging for most conventional machine learning methods. To overcome this problem, we develop and apply a cost-sensitive k nearest neighbor algorithm. Our contributions are two fold: First, we compare the predictive value of several diagnostic procedures for heart disease, including electrocardiography, angiography, radionuclide perfusion and conclude that in womens heart disease, certain combinations of non-invasive techniques are more predictive than some of the widely used invasive procedures. Then, we evaluate held out data and achieve an AUROC over 0.70, signifying valuable clinical utility, using only the least costly and least invasive tests.",AAAI
Detecting Falls with Location Sensors and Accelerometers,2011,"Due to the rapid aging of the population, many technical solutions for the care of the elderly are being developed, often involving fall detection with accelerometers. We present a novel approach to fall detection with location sensors. In our application, a user wears up to four tags on the body whose locations are detected with radio sensors. This makes it possible to recognize the userÃ¢â¬â¢s activity, including falling any lying afterwards, and the context in terms of the location in the apartment. We compared fall detection using location sensors, accelerometers and accelerometers combined with the context. A scenario consisting of events difficult to recognize as falls or non-falls was used for the comparison. The accuracy of the methods that utilized the context was almost 40 percentage points higher compared to the methods without the context. The accuracy of pure location-based methods was around 10 percentage points higher than the accuracy of accelerometers combined with the context.",AAAI
ISIS: a networked-epidemiology based pervasive web app for infectious disease pandemic planning and response,2014,"We describe ISIS, a high-performance-computing-based application to support computational epidemiology of infectious diseases. ISIS has been developed over the last seven years in close coordination with public health and policy experts. It has been used in a number of important federal planning and response exercises. ISIS grew out of years of experience in developing and using HPC-oriented models of complex socially coupled systems. This identified the guiding principle that complex models will be used by domain experts only if they can do realistic analysis without becoming computing experts.
 Using ISIS, one can carry out detailed computational experiments as they pertain to planning and response in the event of a pandemic. ISIS is designed to support networked epidemiology -- study of epidemic processes over social contact networks. The current system can handle airborne infectious diseases such as influenza, pertussis, and smallpox. ISIS is comprised of the following basic components: (i) a web app that serves as the user-interface, (ii) a middleware that coordinates user interaction via the web app with backend models and databases, (iii) a backend computational modeling framework that is comprised of highly resolved epidemic simulations combined with highly realistic control strategies that include pharmaceutical as well as non-pharmaceutical interventions and (iv) a backend data management framework that manages complex unstructured and semi-structured data.
 ISIS has been used in over a dozen case studies defined by the DoD, DHHS, NIH, BARDA and NSC. We describe three recent studies illustrating the use of ISIS in real-world settings:(i) uses of ISIS during the H1N1 pandemic, Cii) supporting a US military planning exercise, and (iii) distribution of limited stockpile of pharmaceuticals using public and private outlets.",KDD
Privacy-preserving data exploration in genome-wide association studies,2013,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have become a popular method for analyzing sets of DNA sequences in order to discover the genetic basis of disease. Unfortunately, statistics published as the result of GWAS can be used to identify individuals participating in the study. To prevent privacy breaches, even previously published results have been removed from public databases, impeding researchers' access to the data and hindering collaborative research. Existing techniques for privacy-preserving GWAS focus on answering specific questions, such as correlations between a given pair of SNPs (DNA sequence variations). This does not fit the typical GWAS process, where the analyst may not know in advance which SNPs to consider and which statistical tests to use, how many SNPs are significant for a given dataset, etc.
 We present a set of practical, privacy-preserving data mining algorithms for GWAS datasets. Our framework supports exploratory data analysis, where the analyst does not know a priori how many and which SNPs to consider. We develop privacy-preserving algorithms for computing the number and location of SNPs that are significantly associated with the disease, the significance of any statistical test between a given SNP and the disease, any measure of correlation between SNPs, and the block structure of correlations. We evaluate our algorithms on real-world datasets and demonstrate that they produce significantly more accurate results than prior techniques while guaranteeing differential privacy.",KDD
Learning to Address Health Inequality in the United States with a Bayesian Decision Network,2019,"Life-expectancy is a complex outcome driven by genetic, socio-demographic, environmental and geographic factors. Increasing socio-economic and health disparities in the United States are propagating the longevity-gap, making it a cause for concern. Earlier studies have probed individual factors but an integrated picture to reveal quantifiable actions has been missing. There is a growing concern about a further widening of healthcare inequality caused by Artificial Intelligence (AI) due to differential access to AI-driven services. Hence, it is imperative to explore and exploit the potential of AI for illuminating biases and enabling transparent policy decisions for positive social and health impact. In this work, we reveal actionable interventions for decreasing the longevitygap in the United States by analyzing a County-level data resource containing healthcare, socio-economic, behavioral, education and demographic features. We learn an ensembleaveraged structure, draw inferences using the joint probability distribution and extend it to a Bayesian Decision Network for identifying policy actions. We draw quantitative estimates for the impact of diversity, preventive-care quality and stablefamilies within the unified framework of our decision network. Finally, we make this analysis and dashboard available as an interactive web-application for enabling users and policy-makers to validate our reported findings and to explore the impact of ones beyond reported in this work.",AAAI
Functional Annotation of Human Protein Coding Isoforms via Non-convex Multi-Instance Learning,2017,"Functional annotation of human genes is fundamentally important for understanding the molecular basis of various genetic diseases. A major challenge in determining the functions of human genes lies in the functional diversity of proteins, that is, a gene can perform different functions as it may consist of multiple protein coding isoforms (PCIs). Therefore, differentiating functions of PCIs can significantly deepen our understanding of the functions of genes. However, due to the lack of isoform-level gold-standards (ground-truth annotation), many existing functional annotation approaches are developed at gene-level. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to differentiate the functions of PCIs by integrating sparse simplex projection---that is, a nonconvex sparsity-inducing regularizer---with the framework of multi-instance learning (MIL). Specifically, we label the genes that are annotated to the function under consideration as positive bags and the genes without the function as negative bags. Then, by sparse projections onto simplex, we learn a mapping that embeds the original bag space to a discriminative feature space. Our framework is flexible to incorporate various smooth and non-smooth loss functions such as logistic loss and hinge loss. To solve the resulting highly nontrivial non-convex and non-smooth optimization problem, we further develop an efficient block coordinate descent algorithm. Extensive experiments on human genome data demonstrate that the proposed approaches significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods in terms of functional annotation accuracy of human PCIs and efficiency.",KDD
Fastanova: an efficient algorithm for genome-wide association study,2008,"Studying the association between quantitative phenotype (such as height or weight) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is an important problem in biology. To understand underlying mechanisms of complex phenotypes, it is often necessary to consider joint genetic effects across multiple SNPs. ANOVA (analysis of variance) test is routinely used in association study. Important findings from studying gene-gene (SNP-pair) interactions are appearing in the literature. However, the number of SNPs can be up to millions. Evaluating joint effects of SNPs is a challenging task even for SNP-pairs. Moreover, with large number of SNPs correlated, permutation procedure is preferred over simple Bonferroni correction for properly controlling family-wise error rate and retaining mapping power, which dramatically increases the computational cost of association study.
 In this paper, we study the problem of finding SNP-pairs that have significant associations with a given quantitative phenotype. We propose an efficient algorithm, FastANOVA, for performing ANOVA tests on SNP-pairs in a batch mode, which also supports large permutation test. We derive an upper bound of SNP-pair ANOVA test, which can be expressed as the sum of two terms. The first term is based on single-SNP ANOVA test. The second term is based on the SNPs and independent of any phenotype permutation. Furthermore, SNP-pairs can be organized into groups, each of which shares a common upper bound. This allows for maximum reuse of intermediate computation, efficient upper bound estimation, and effective SNP-pair pruning. Consequently, FastANOVA only needs to perform the ANOVA test on a small number of candidate SNP-pairs without the risk of missing any significant ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FastANOVA is orders of magnitude faster than the brute-force implementation of ANOVA tests on all SNP pairs.",KDD
Explaining Genetic Knock-Out Effects Using Cost-Based Abduction,2011,"Cost-Based Abduction (CBA) is an AI model for reasoning under uncertainty. In CBA, evidence to be explained is treated as a goal which is true and must be proven. Each proof of the goal is viewed as a feasible explanation and has a cost equal to the sum of the costs of all hypotheses that are assumed to complete the proof. The aim is to find the Least Cost Proof. This paper uses CBA to develop a novel method for modeling Genetic Regulatory Networks (GRN) and explaining genetic knock-out effects. Constructing GRN using multiple data sources is a fundamental problem in computational biology. We show that CBA is a powerful formalism for modeling GRN that can easily and effectively integrate multiple sources of biological data. In this paper, we use three different biological data sources: Protein-DNA, ProteinÃ¢â¬âProtein and gene knock-out data. Using this data, we first create an un-annotated graph; CBA then annotates the graph by assigning a sign and a direction to each edge. Our biological results are promising; however, this manuscript focuses on the mathematical modeling of the application. The advantages of CBA and its relation to Bayesian inference are also presented.",IJCAI
Two-locus association mapping in subquadratic time,2011,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have not been able to discover strong associations between many complex human diseases and single genetic loci. Mapping these phenotypes to pairs of genetic loci is hindered by the huge number of candidates leading to enormous computational and statistical problems. In GWAS on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), one has to consider in the order of 1010 to 1014 pairs, which is infeasible in practice. In this article, we give the first algorithm for 2-locus genome-wide association studies that is subquadratic in the number, n, of SNPs. The running time of our algorithm is data-dependent, but large experiments over real genomic data suggest that it scales empirically as n3/2. As a result, our algorithm can easily cope with n ~ 107, i.e., it can efficiently search all pairs of SNPs in the human genome.",KDD
Structural Deep Brain Network Mining,2017,"Mining from neuroimaging data is becoming increasingly popular in the field of healthcare and bioinformatics, due to its potential to discover clinically meaningful structure patterns that could facilitate the understanding and diagnosis of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Most recent research concentrates on applying subgraph mining techniques to discover connected subgraph patterns in the brain network. However, the underlying brain network structure is complicated. As a shallow linear model, subgraph mining cannot capture the highly non-linear structures, resulting in sub-optimal patterns. Therefore, how to learn representations that can capture the highly non-linearity of brain networks and preserve the underlying structures is a critical problem.
 In this paper, we propose a Structural Deep Brain Network mining method, namely SDBN, to learn highly non-linear and structure-preserving representations of brain networks. Specifically, we first introduce a novel graph reordering approach based on module identification, which rearranges the order of the nodes to preserve the modular structure of the graph. Next, we perform structural augmentation to further enhance the spatial information of the reordered graph. Then we propose a deep feature learning framework for combining supervised learning and unsupervised learning in a small-scale setting, by augmenting Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with decoding pathways for reconstruction. With the help of the multiple layers of non-linear mapping, the proposed SDBN approach can capture the highly non-linear structure of brain networks. Further, it has better generalization capability for high-dimensional brain networks and works well even for small sample learning. Benefit from CNN's task-oriented learning style, the learned hierarchical representation is meaningful for the clinical task. To evaluate the proposed SDBN method, we conduct extensive experiments on four real brain network datasets for disease diagnoses. The experiment results show that SDBN can capture discriminative and meaningful structural graph representations for brain disorder diagnosis.",KDD
On the Generative Discovery of Structured Medical Knowledge,2018,"Online healthcare services can provide the general public with ubiquitous access to medical knowledge and reduce medical information access cost for both individuals and societies. However, expanding the scale of high-quality yet structured medical knowledge usually comes with tedious efforts in data preparation and human annotation. To promote the benefits while minimizing the data requirement in expanding medical knowledge, we introduce a generative perspective to study the relational medical entity pair discovery problem. A generative model named Conditional Relationship Variational Autoencoder is proposed to discover meaningful and novel medical entity pairs by purely learning from the expression diversity in the existing relational medical entity pairs. Unlike discriminative approaches where high-quality contexts and candidate medical entity pairs are carefully prepared to be examined by the model, the proposed model generates novel entity pairs directly by sampling from a learned latent space without further data requirement. The proposed model explores the generative modeling capacity for medical entity pairs while incorporating deep learning for hands-free feature engineering. It is not only able to generate meaningful medical entity pairs that are not yet observed, but also can generate entity pairs for a specific medical relationship. The proposed model adjusts the initial representations of medical entities by addressing their relational commonalities. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on real-world relational medical entity pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in generating relational medical entity pairs that are meaningful and novel.",KDD
A Treatment Engine by Predicting Next-Period Prescriptions,2018,"Recent years have witnessed an opportunity for improving healthcare efficiency and quality by mining Electronic Medical Records (EMRs). This paper is aimed at developing a treatment engine, which learns from historical EMR data and provides a patient with next-period prescriptions based on disease conditions, laboratory results, and treatment records of the patient. Importantly, the engine takes consideration of both treatment records and physical examination sequences which are not only heterogeneous and temporal in nature but also often with different record frequencies and lengths. Moreover, the engine also combines static information (e.g., demographics) with the temporal sequences to provide personalized treatment prescriptions to patients. In this regard, a novel Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) learning framework is proposed to model inter-correlations of different types of medical sequences by connections between hidden neurons. With this framework, we develop three multifaceted LSTM models: Fully Connected Heterogeneous LSTM, Partially Connected Heterogeneous LSTM, and Decomposed Heterogeneous LSTM. The experiments are conducted on two datasets: one is the public MIMIC-III ICU data, and the other comes from several Chinese hospitals. Experimental results reveal the effectiveness of the framework and the three models. The work is deemed important and meaningful for both academia and practitioners in the realm of medical treatment and prediction, as well as in other fields of applications where intelligent decision support becomes pervasive.",KDD
Temporal Phenotyping from Longitudinal Electronic Health Records: A Graph Based Framework,2015,"The rapid growth in the development of healthcare information systems has led to an increased interest in utilizing the patient Electronic Health Records (EHR) for assisting disease diagnosis and phenotyping. The patient EHRs are generally longitudinal and naturally represented as medical event sequences, where the events include clinical notes, problems, medications, vital signs, laboratory reports, etc. The longitudinal and heterogeneous properties make EHR analysis an inherently difficult challenge. To address this challenge, in this paper, we develop a novel representation, namely the temporal graph, for such event sequences. The temporal graph is informative for a variety of challenging analytic tasks, such as predictive modeling, since it can capture temporal relationships of the medical events in each event sequence. By summarizing the longitudinal data, the temporal graphs are also robust and resistant to noisy and irregular observations. Based on the temporal graph representation, we further develop an approach for temporal phenotyping to identify the most significant and interpretable graph basis as phenotypes. This helps us better understand the disease evolving patterns. Moreover, by expressing the temporal graphs with the phenotypes, the expressing coefficients can be used for applications such as personalized medicine, disease diagnosis, and patient segmentation. Our temporal phenotyping framework is also flexible to incorporate semi-supervised/supervised information. Finally, we validate our framework on two real-world tasks. One is predicting the onset risk of heart failure. Another is predicting the risk of heart failure related hospitalization for patients with COPD pre-condition. Our results show that the diagnosis performance in both tasks can be improved significantly by the proposed approaches. Also, we illustrate some interesting phenotypes derived from the data.",KDD
Resolving the Bias in Electronic Medical Records,2017,"Electronic Medical Records (EMR) are the most fundamental resources used in healthcare data analytics. Since people visit hospital more frequently when they feel sick and doctors prescribe lab examinations when they feel necessary, we argue that there could be a strong bias in EMR observations compared with the hidden conditions of patients. Directly using such EMR for analytical tasks without considering the bias may lead to misinterpretation. To this end, we propose a general method to resolve the bias by transforming EMR to regular patient hidden condition series using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) variant. Compared with the biased EMR series with irregular time stamps, the unbiased regular time series is much easier to be processed by most analytical models and yields better results. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our bias resolving method imputes missing data more accurately than baselines and improves the performance of the state-of-the-art methods on typical medical data analytics.",KDD
Releasing eHealth Analytics into the Wild: Lessons Learnt from the SPHERE Project,2018,"The SPHERE project is devoted to advancing eHealth in a smart-home context, and supports full-scale sensing and data analysis to enable a generic healthcare service.

Estimating Treatment Effect in the Wild via Differentiated Confounder Balancing,2017,"Estimating treatment effect plays an important role on decision making in many fields, such as social marketing, healthcare, and public policy. The key challenge on estimating treatment effect in the wild observational studies is to handle confounding bias induced by imbalance of the confounder distributions between treated and control units. Traditional methods remove confounding bias by re-weighting units with supposedly accurate propensity score estimation under the unconfoundedness assumption. Controlling high-dimensional variables may make the unconfoundedness assumption more plausible, but poses new challenge on accurate propensity score estimation. One strand of recent literature seeks to directly optimize weights to balance confounder distributions, bypassing propensity score estimation. But existing balancing methods fail to do selection and differentiation among the pool of a large number of potential confounders, leading to possible underperformance in many high dimensional settings. In this paper, we propose a data-driven Differentiated Confounder Balancing (DCB) algorithm to jointly select confounders, differentiate weights of confounders and balance confounder distributions for treatment effect estimation in the wild high dimensional settings. The synergistic learning algorithm we proposed is more capable of reducing the confounding bias in many observational studies. To validate the effectiveness of our DCB algorithm, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that our DCB algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. We further show that the top features ranked by our algorithm generate accurate prediction of online advertising effect.",KDD
Optimized Risk Scores,2017,"Risk scores are simple classification models that let users quickly assess risk by adding, subtracting, and multiplying a few small numbers. Such models are widely used in healthcare and criminal justice, but are often built ad hoc. In this paper, we present a principled approach to learn risk scores that are fully optimized for feature selection, integer coefficients, and operational constraints. We formulate the risk score problem as a mixed integer nonlinear program, and present a new cutting plane algorithm to efficiently recover its optimal solution. Our approach can fit optimized risk scores in a way that scales linearly with the sample size of a dataset, provides a proof of optimality, and obeys complex constraints without parameter tuning. We illustrate these benefits through an extensive set of numerical experiments, and an application where we build a customized risk score for ICU seizure prediction.",KDD
FLASH: Fast Bayesian Optimization for Data Analytic Pipelines,2016,"Modern data science relies on data analytic pipelines to organize interdependent computational steps. Such analytic pipelines often involve different algorithms across multiple steps, each with its own hyperparameters. To achieve the best performance, it is often critical to select optimal algorithms and to set appropriate hyperparameters, which requires large computational efforts. Bayesian optimization provides a principled way for searching optimal hyperparameters for a single algorithm. However, many challenges remain in solving pipeline optimization problems with high-dimensional and highly conditional search space. In this work, we propose Fast LineAr SearcH (FLASH), an efficient method for tuning analytic pipelines. FLASH is a two-layer Bayesian optimization framework, which firstly uses a parametric model to select promising algorithms, then computes a nonparametric model to fine-tune hyperparameters of the promising algorithms. FLASH also includes an effective caching algorithm which can further accelerate the search process. Extensive experiments on a number of benchmark datasets have demonstrated that FLASH significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both search speed and accuracy. Using 50% of the time budget, FLASH achieves up to 20% improvement on test error rate compared to the baselines. FLASH also yields state-of-the-art performance on a real-world application for healthcare predictive modeling.",KDD
Revisiting sequential pattern hiding to enhance utility,2011,"Sequence datasets are encountered in a plethora of applications spanning from web usage analysis to healthcare studies and ubiquitous computing. Disseminating such datasets offers remarkable opportunities for discovering interesting knowledge patterns, but may lead to serious privacy violations if sensitive patterns, such as business secrets, are disclosed. In this work, we consider how to sanitize data to prevent the disclosure of sensitive patterns during sequential pattern mining, while ensuring that the nonsensitive patterns can still be discovered. First, we re-define the problem of sequential pattern hiding to capture the information loss incurred by sanitization in terms of both events' modification (distortion) and lost nonsensitive knowledge patterns (side-effects). Second, we model sequences as graphs and propose two algorithms to solve the problem by operating on the graphs. The first algorithm attempts to sanitize data with minimal distortion, whereas the second focuses on reducing the side-effects. Extensive experiments show that our algorithms outperform the existing solution in terms of data distortion and side-effects and are more efficient.",KDD
GRAM: Graph-based Attention Model for Healthcare Representation Learning,2017,"Deep learning methods exhibit promising performance for predictive modeling in healthcare, but two important challenges remain: -
 Data insufficiency: Often in healthcare predictive modeling, the sample size is insufficient for deep learning methods to achieve satisfactory results.
 Interpretation: The representations learned by deep learning methods should align with medical knowledge.
 To address these challenges, we propose GRaph-based Attention Model (GRAM) that supplements electronic health records (EHR) with hierarchical information inherent to medical ontologies. Based on the data volume and the ontology structure, GRAM represents a medical concept as a combination of its ancestors in the ontology via an attention mechanism.
 We compared predictive performance (i.e. accuracy, data needs, interpretability) of GRAM to various methods including the recurrent neural network (RNN) in two sequential diagnoses prediction tasks and one heart failure prediction task. Compared to the basic RNN, GRAM achieved 10% higher accuracy for predicting diseases rarely observed in the training data and 3% improved area under the ROC curve for predicting heart failure using an order of magnitude less training data. Additionally, unlike other methods, the medical concept representations learned by GRAM are well aligned with the medical ontology. Finally, GRAM exhibits intuitive attention behaviors by adaptively generalizing to higher level concepts when facing data insufficiency at the lower level concepts.",KDD
Intelligible Models for HealthCare: Predicting Pneumonia Risk and Hospital 30-day Readmission,2015,"In machine learning often a tradeoff must be made between accuracy and intelligibility. More accurate models such as boosted trees, random forests, and neural nets usually are not intelligible, but more intelligible models such as logistic regression, naive-Bayes, and single decision trees often have significantly worse accuracy. This tradeoff sometimes limits the accuracy of models that can be applied in mission-critical applications such as healthcare where being able to understand, validate, edit, and trust a learned model is important. We present two case studies where high-performance generalized additive models with pairwise interactions (GA2Ms) are applied to real healthcare problems yielding intelligible models with state-of-the-art accuracy. In the pneumonia risk prediction case study, the intelligible model uncovers surprising patterns in the data that previously had prevented complex learned models from being fielded in this domain, but because it is intelligible and modular allows these patterns to be recognized and removed. In the 30-day hospital readmission case study, we show that the same methods scale to large datasets containing hundreds of thousands of patients and thousands of attributes while remaining intelligible and providing accuracy comparable to the best (unintelligible) machine learning methods.",KDD
Pre-training of Graph Augmented Transformers for Medication Recommendation,2019,"""Medication recommendation is an important healthcare application.It is commonly formulated as a temporal prediction task. Hence, most existing works only utilize longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) from a small number of patients with multiple visits ignoring a large number of patients with a single visit (selection bias). Moreover, important hierarchical knowledge such as diagnosis hierarchy is not leveraged in the representation learning process. Despite the success of deep learning techniques in computational phenotyping, most previous approaches have two limitations: task-oriented representation and ignoring hierarchies of medical codes. To address these challenges, we propose G-BERT,a new model to combine the power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for medical code representation and medication recommendation. We useGNNs to represent the internal hierarchical structures of medical codes. Then we integrate the GNN representation into a transformer-based visit encoder and pre-train it on EHR data from patients only with a single visit. The pre-trained visit encoder and representation are then fine-tuned for downstream predictive tasks on longitudinal EHRs from patients with multiple visits. G-BERT is the first to bring the language model pre-training schema into the healthcare domain and it achieved state-of-the-art performance on the medication recommendation task.""",IJCAI
SparseSense: Human Activity Recognition from Highly Sparse Sensor Data-streams Using Set-based Neural Networks,2019,"Batteryless or so called passive wearables are providing new and innovative methods for human activity recognition (HAR), especially in healthcare applications for older people. Passive sensors are low cost, lightweight, unobtrusive and desirably disposable; attractive attributes for healthcare applications in hospitals and nursing homes. Despite the compelling propositions for sensing applications, the data streams from these sensors are characterised by high sparsity---the time intervals between sensor readings are irregular while the number of readings per unit time are often limited.Ã In this paper, we rigorously explore the problem of learning activity recognition models from temporally sparse data.Ã We describe how to learn directly from sparse data using a deep learning paradigm in an end-to-end manner.

Further, we provide insights into the model's behaviour through complementary experiments on a benchmark dataset and visualisation of the learned activity feature spaces.",IJCAI
Survival Prediction by an Integrated Learning Criterion on Intermittently Varying Healthcare Data,2016,"Survival prediction is crucial to healthcare research, but is confined primarily to specific types of data involving only the present measurements. This paper considers the more general class of healthcare data found in practice, which includes a wealth of intermittently varying historical measurements in addition to the present measurements. Making survival predictions on such data bristles with challenges to the existing prediction models. For this reason, we propose a new semi-proportional hazards model using locally time-varying coefficients, and a novel complete-data model learning criterion for coefficient optimization. Experiments on the healthcare data demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our model and its promise in practical applications.",AAAI
Temporal Probabilistic Profiles for Sepsis Prediction in the ICU,2019,"Sepsis is a condition caused by the body's overwhelming and life-threatening response to infection, which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and finally death. Today, sepsis is one of the leading causes of mortality among populations in intensive care units (ICUs). Sepsis is difficult to predict, diagnose, and treat, as it involves analyzing different sets of multivariate time-series, usually with problems of missing data, different sampling frequencies, and random noise. Here, we propose a new dynamic-behavior-based model, which we call a Temporal Probabilistic proFile (TPF), for classification and prediction tasks of multivariate time series. In the TPF method, the raw, time-stamped data are first abstracted into a series of higher-level, meaningful concepts, which hold over intervals characterizing time periods. We then discover frequently repeating temporal patterns within the data. Using the discovered patterns, we create a probabilistic distribution of the temporal patterns of the overall entity population, of each target class in it, and of each entity. We then exploit TPFs as meta-features to classify the time series of new entities, or to predict their outcome, by measuring their TPF distance, either to the aggregated TPF of each class, or to the individual TPFs of each of the entities, using negative cross entropy. Our experimental results on a large benchmark clinical data set show that TPFs improve sepsis prediction capabilities, and perform better than other machine learning approaches.",KDD

Personalized Donor-Recipient Matching for Organ Transplantation,2017,"Organ transplants can improve the life expectancy and quality of life for the recipient but carry the risk of serious post-operative complications, such as septic shock and organ rejection. The probability of a successful transplant depends in a very subtle fashion on compatibility between the donor and the recipient - but current medical practice is short of domain knowledge regarding the complex nature of recipient-donor compatibility. Hence a data-driven approach for learning compatibility has the potential for significant improvements in match quality. This paper proposes a novel system (ConfidentMatch) that is trained using data from electronic health records. ConfidentMatch predicts the success of an organ transplant (in terms of the 3-year survival rates) on the basis of clinical and demographic traits of the donor and recipient. ConfidentMatch captures the heterogeneity of the donor and recipient traits by optimally dividing the feature space into clusters and constructing different optimal predictive models to each cluster. The system controls the complexity of the learned predictive model in a way that allows for assuring more granular and accurate predictions for a larger number of potential recipient-donor pairs, thereby ensuring that predictions are ""personalized"" and tailored to individual characteristics to the finest possible granularity. Experiments conducted on the UNOS heart transplant dataset show the superiority of the prognostic value of ConfidentMatch to other competing benchmarks; ConfidentMatch can provide predictions of success with 95% accuracy for 5,489 patients of a total population of 9,620 patients, which corresponds to 410 more patients than the most competitive benchmark algorithm (DeepBoost).",AAAI

Collecting and Analyzing Millions of mHealth Data Streams,2017,"Players across the health ecosystem are initiating studies of thousands, even millions, of participants to gather diverse types of data, including biomedical, behavioral, and lifestyle in order to advance medical research. These efforts to collect multi-modal data sets on large cohorts coincide with the rise of broad activity and behavior tracking across industries, particularly in healthcare and the growing field of mobile health (mHealth). Government and pharmaceutical sponsored, as well as patient-driven group studies in this arena leverage the ability of mobile technology to continuously track behaviors and environmental factors with minimal participant burden. However, the adoption of mHealth has been constrained by the lack of robust solutions for large-scale data collection in free-living conditions and concerns around data quality. In this work, we describe the infrastructure Evidation Health has developed to collect mHealth data from millions of users through hundreds of different mobile devices and apps. Additionally, we provide evidence of the utility of the data for inferring individual traits pertaining to health, wellness, and behavior. To this end, we introduce and evaluate deep neural network models that achieve high prediction performance without requiring any feature engineering when trained directly on the densely sampled multivariate mHealth time series data. We believe that the present work substantiates both the feasibility and the utility of creating a very large mHealth research cohort, as envisioned by the many large cohort studies currently underway across therapeutic areas and conditions.",KDD
PGANs: Personalized Generative Adversarial Networks for ECG Synthesis to Improve Patient-Specific Deep ECG Classification,2019,"The Electrocardiogram (ECG) is performed routinely by medical personnel to identify structural, functional and electrical cardiac events.

These variations are challenging for deep learning algorithms, and impede generalization. In this work, we propose a semisupervised approach for patient-specific ECG classification.

We present CheXpert, a large dataset that contains 224,316 chest radiographs of 65,240 patients. We design a labeler to automatically detect the presence of 14 observations in radiology reports, capturing uncertainties inherent in radiograph interpretation. We investigate different approaches to using the uncertainty labels for training convolutional neural networks that output the probability of these observations given the available frontal and lateral radiographs. On a validation set of 200 chest radiographic studies which were manually annotated by 3 board-certified radiologists, we find that different uncertainty approaches are useful for different pathologies. We then evaluate our best model on a test set composed of 500 chest radiographic studies annotated by a consensus of 5 board-certified radiologists, and compare the performance of our model to that of 3 additional radiologists in the detection of 5 selected pathologies. On Cardiomegaly, Edema, and Pleural Effusion, the model ROC and PR curves lie above all 3 radiologist operating points. We release the dataset to the public as a standard benchmark to evaluate performance of chest radiograph interpretation models.",AAAI
SPARTan: Scalable PARAFAC2 for Large & Sparse Data,2017,"In exploratory tensor mining, a common problem is how to analyze a set of variables across a set of subjects whose observations do not align naturally. For example, when modeling medical features across a set of patients, the number and duration of treatments may vary widely in time, meaning there is no meaningful way to align their clinical records across time points for analysis purposes. To handle such data, the state-of-the-art tensor model is the so-called PARAFAC2, which yields interpretable and robust output and can naturally handle sparse data. However, its main limitation up to now has been the lack of efficient algorithms that can handle large-scale datasets.
 In this work, we fill this gap by developing a scalable method to compute the PARAFAC2 decomposition of large and sparse datasets, called SPARTan. Our method exploits special structure within PARAFAC2, leading to a novel algorithmic reformulation that is both faster (in absolute time) and more memory-efficient than prior work. We evaluate SPARTan on both synthetic and real datasets, showing 22X performance gains over the best previous implementation and also handling larger problem instances for which the baseline fails. Furthermore, we are able to apply SPARTan to the mining of temporally-evolving phenotypes on data taken from real and medically complex pediatric patients. The clinical meaningfulness of the phenotypes identified in this process, as well as their temporal evolution over time for several patients, have been endorsed by clinical experts.",KDD
Optimal Action Extraction for Random Forests and Boosted Trees,2015,"Additive tree models (ATMs) are widely used for data mining and machine learning. Important examples of ATMs include random forest, adaboost (with decision trees as weak learners), and gradient boosted trees, and they are often referred to as the best off-the-shelf classifiers. Though capable of attaining high accuracy, ATMs are not well interpretable in the sense that they do not provide actionable knowledge for a given instance. This greatly limits the potential of ATMs on many applications such as medical prediction and business intelligence, where practitioners need suggestions on actions that can lead to desirable outcomes with minimum costs.
 To address this problem, we present a novel framework to post-process any ATM classifier to extract an optimal actionable plan that can change a given input to a desired class with a minimum cost. In particular, we prove the NP-hardness of the optimal action extraction problem for ATMs and formulate this problem in an integer linear programming formulation which can be efficiently solved by existing packages. We also empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework by conducting comprehensive experiments on challenging real-world datasets.",KDD

In the training phase, it takes as input an encrypted training data and outputs an encrypted model without ever decrypting. In the prediction phase, it uses the encrypted model to predict results on new encrypted data. In each phase, no decryption key is needed, and thus the data privacy is ultimately guaranteed. It has many applications in various areas such as finance, education, genomics, and medical field that have sensitive private data. While several studies have been reported on the prediction phase, few studies have been conducted on the training phase.",AAAI
Semi-Supervised Biomedical Translation with Cycle Wasserstein Regression GANs,2018,"The biomedical field offers many learning tasks that share unique challenges: large amounts of unpaired data, and a high cost to generate labels. In this work, we develop a method to address these issues with semi-supervised learning in regression tasks (e.g., translation from source to target). Our model uses adversarial signals to learn from unpaired datapoints, and imposes a cycle-loss reconstruction error penalty to regularize mappings in either direction against one another. We first evaluate our method on synthetic experiments, demonstrating two primary advantages of the system: 1) distribution matching via the adversarial loss and 2) regularization towards invertible mappings via the cycle loss. We then show a regularization effect and improved performance when paired data is supplemented by additional unpaired data on two real biomedical regression tasks: estimating the physiological effect of medical treatments, and extrapolating gene expression (transcriptomics) signals. Our proposed technique is a promising initial step towards more robust use of adversarial signals in semi-supervised regression, and could be useful for other tasks (e.g., causal inference or modality translation) in the biomedical field.",AAAI
A Framework for Outlier Description Using Constraint Programming,2016,"Outlier detection has been studied extensively and employed in diverse applications in the past decades. In this paper we formulate a related yet understudied problem which we call outlier description. This problem often arises in practice when we have a small number of data instances that had been identified to be outliers and we wish to explain why they are outliers. We propose a framework based on constraint programming to find an optimal subset of features that most differentiates the outliers and normal instances. We further demonstrate the framework offers great flexibility in incorporating diverse scenarios arising in practice such as multiple explanations and human in the loop extensions. We empirically evaluate our proposed framework on real datasets, including medical imaging and text corpus, and demonstrate how the results are useful and interpretable in these domains.",AAAI
Privacy and Regression Model Preserved Learning,2014,"Sensitive data such as medical records and business reports usually contains valuable information that can be used to build prediction models. However, designing learning models by directly using sensitive data might result in severe privacy and copyright issues. In this paper, we propose a novel matrix completion based framework that aims to tackle two challenging issues simultaneously: i) handling missing and noisy sensitive data, and ii) preserving the privacy of the sensitive data during the learning process. In particular, the proposed framework is able to mask the sensitive data while ensuring that the transformed data are still usable for training regression models. We show that two key properties, namely model preserving and privacy preserving, are satisfied by the transformed data obtained from the proposed framework. In model preserving, we guarantee that the linear regression model built from the masked data approximates the regression model learned from the original data in a perfect way. In privacy preserving, we ensure that the original sensitive data cannot be recovered since the transformation procedure is irreversible. Given these two characteristics, the transformed data can be safely released to any learners for designing prediction models without revealing any private content. Our empirical studies with a synthesized dataset and multiple sensitive benchmark datasets verify our theoretical claim as well as the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",AAAI
Detection and Prediction of Adverse and Anomalous Events in Medical Robots,2013,"Adverse and anomalous (A&A) events are a serious concern in medical robots. We describe a system that can rapidly detect such events and predict their occurrence. As part of this system, we describe simulation, data collection and user interface tools we build for a robot for small animal biopsies. The data we collect consists of both the hardware state of the robot and variables in the software controller.We use this data to train dynamic Bayesian network models of the joint hardware-software state-space dynamics of the robot. Our empirical evaluation shows that (i) our models can accurately model normal behavior of the robot, (ii) they can rapidly detect anomalous behavior once it starts, (iii) they can accurately predict a future A&A event within a time window of it starting and (iv) the use of additional software variables beyond the hardware state of the robot is important in being able to detect and predict certain kinds of events.",AAAI
Advisor Agent Support for Issue Tracking in Medical Device Development,2012,"This case study concerns the use of software agent advisors to improve efficiency and quality in issue tracking activities of development teams at the world's largest medical device manufacturer. Each software agent monitors, interacts with, and learns from its environment and user, recognizing when and how to provide different kinds of advice and support to facilitate issue tracking activities without directly modifying anything or otherwise violating domain constraints. The deployed software agent has not only enjoyed regular and growing use, but contributed to significant improvements. Issue rejection was significantly reduced and more focused, yielding significant quality and efficiency gains such as fewer reviews by quality assurance. This success reflects the benefits of the underlying AI technology.",AAAI
Deep Landscape Forecasting for Real-time Bidding Advertising,2019,"The emergence of real-time auction in online advertising has drawn huge attention of modeling the market competition, i.e., bid landscape forecasting. The problem is formulated as to forecast the probability distribution of market price for each ad auction. With the consideration of the censorship issue which is caused by the second-price auction mechanism, many researchers have devoted their efforts on bid landscape forecasting by incorporating survival analysis from medical research field. However, most existing solutions mainly focus on either counting-based statistics of the segmented sample clusters, or learning a parameterized model based on some heuristic assumptions of distribution forms. Moreover, they neither consider the sequential patterns of the feature over the price space. In order to capture more sophisticated yet flexible patterns at fine-grained level of the data, we propose a Deep Landscape Forecasting (DLF) model which combines deep learning for probability distribution forecasting and survival analysis for censorship handling. Specifically, we utilize a recurrent neural network to flexibly model the conditional winning probability w.r.t. each bid price. Then we conduct the bid landscape forecasting through probability chain rule with strict mathematical derivations. And, in an end-to-end manner, we optimize the model by minimizing two negative likelihood losses with comprehensive motivations. Without any specific assumption for the distribution form of bid landscape, our model shows great advantages over previous works on fitting various sophisticated market price distributions. In the experiments over two large-scale real-world datasets, our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions under various metrics.",KDD
Hypothesis Generation From Text Based On Co-Evolution Of Biomedical Concepts,2019,"Hypothesis generation (HG) refers to the task of mining meaningful implicit association between unlinked biomedical concepts. The majority of prior studies have focused on uncovering these implicit linkages from static snapshots of the corpus, thereby largely ignoring the temporal dynamics of medical concepts. More recently, a few initial studies attempted to overcome this issue by modelling the temporal change of concepts from natural language text. However, they still fail to leverage the evolutionary features of concepts from contemporary knowledge-bases (KB's) such as semantic lexicons and ontologies. In practice such KB's contain up-to-date information that is important to incorporate, especially, in highly evolving domains such as biomedicine. Furthermore, considering the complementary strength of these sources of information - corpus and ontology - a few natural questions arise: Can joint modelling of (co)-evolutionary dynamics from these resources aid in encoding the temporal features at a granular level? Can the mutual evolution between these intertwined resources lead to better predictive effects? To answer these questions, in this study, we present a novel HG framework that unearths the latent associations between concepts by modeling their co-evolution across complementary sources of information. More specifically, the proposed approach adopts a shared temporal matrix factorization framework that models the co-evolution of concepts across both corpus and KB. Extensive experiments on the largest available biomedical corpus validates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",KDD
Exact and Consistent Interpretation for Piecewise Linear Neural Networks: A Closed Form Solution,2018,"Strong intelligent machines powered by deep neural networks are increasingly deployed as black boxes to make decisions in risk-sensitive domains, such as finance and medical. To reduce potential risk and build trust with users, it is critical to interpret how such machines make their decisions. Existing works interpret a pre-trained neural network by analyzing hidden neurons, mimicking pre-trained models or approximating local predictions. However, these methods do not provide a guarantee on the exactness and consistency of their interpretations. In this paper, we propose an elegant closed form solution named $OpenBox$ to compute exact and consistent interpretations for the family of Piecewise Linear Neural Networks (PLNN). The major idea is to first transform a PLNN into a mathematically equivalent set of linear classifiers, then interpret each linear classifier by the features that dominate its prediction. We further apply $OpenBox$ to demonstrate the effectiveness of non-negative and sparse constraints on improving the interpretability of PLNNs. The extensive experiments on both synthetic and real world data sets clearly demonstrate the exactness and consistency of our interpretation.",KDD
A Data-driven Process Recommender Framework,2017,We present an approach for improving the performance of complex knowledge-based processes by providing data-driven step-by-step recommendations. Our framework uses the associations between similar historic process performances and contextual information to determine the prototypical way of enacting the process. We introduce a novel similarity metric for grouping traces into clusters that incorporates temporal information about activity performance and handles concurrent activities. Our data-driven recommender system selects the appropriate prototype performance of the process based on user-provided context attributes. Our approach for determining the prototypes discovers the commonly performed activities and their temporal relationships. We tested our system on data from three real-world medical processes and achieved recommendation accuracy up to an F1 score of 0.77 (compared to an F1 score of 0.37 using ZeroR) with 63.2% of recommended enactments being within the first five neighbors of the actual historic enactments in a set of 87 cases. Our framework works as an interactive visual analytic tool for process mining. This work shows the feasibility of data-driven decision support system for complex knowledge-based processes.,KDD
Selecting a characteristic set of reviews,2012,"Online reviews provide consumers with valuable information that guides their decisions on a variety of fronts: from entertainment and shopping to medical services. Although the proliferation of online reviews gives insights about different aspects of a product, it can also prove a serious drawback: consumers cannot and will not read thousands of reviews before making a purchase decision. This need to extract useful information from large review corpora has spawned considerable prior work, but so far all have drawbacks. Review summarization (generating statistical descriptions of review sets) sacrifices the immediacy and narrative structure of reviews. Likewise, review selection (identifying a subset of 'helpful' or 'important' reviews) leads to redundant or non-representative summaries. In this paper, we fill the gap between existing review-summarization and review-selection methods by selecting a small subset of reviews that together preserve the statistical properties of the entire review corpus. We formalize this task as a combinatorial optimization problem and show that it NP-hard both tosolve and approximate. We also design effective algorithms that prove to work well in practice. Our experiments with real review corpora on different types of products demonstrate the utility of our methods, and our user studies indicate that our methods provide a better summary than prior approaches.",KDD
Selecting a comprehensive set of reviews,2011,"Online user reviews play a central role in the decision-making process of users for a variety of tasks, ranging from entertainment and shopping to medical services. As user-generated reviews proliferate, it becomes critical to have a mechanism for helping the users (information consumers) deal with the information overload, and presenting them with a small comprehensive set of reviews that satisfies their information need. This is particularly important for mobile phone users, who need to make decisions quickly, and have a device with limited screen real-estate for displaying the reviews. Previous approaches have addressed the problem by ranking reviews according to their (estimated) helpfulness. However, such approaches do not account for the fact that the top few high-quality reviews may be highly redundant, repeating the same information, or presenting the same positive (or negative) perspective. In this work, we focus on the problem of selecting a comprehensive set of few high-quality reviews that cover many different aspects of the reviewed item. We formulate the problem as a maximum coverage problem, and we present a generic formalism that can model the different variants of review-set selection. We describe algorithms for the different variants we consider, and, whenever possible, we provide approximation guarantees with respect to the optimal solution. We also perform an experimental evaluation on real data in order to understand the value of coverage for users.",KDD
Bounded coordinate-descent for biological sequence classification in high dimensional predictor space,2011,"We present a framework for discriminative sequence classification where linear classifiers work directly in the explicit high-dimensional predictor space of all subsequences in the training set (as opposed to kernel-induced spaces). This is made feasible by employing a gradient-bounded coordinate-descent algorithm for efficiently selecting discriminative subsequences without having to expand the whole space. Our framework can be applied to a wide range of loss functions, including binomial log-likelihood loss of logistic regression and squared hinge loss of support vector machines. When applied to protein remote homology detection and remote fold recognition, our framework achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art (e.g., kernel support vector machines). In contrast to state-of-the-art sequence classifiers, our models are simply lists of weighted discriminative subsequences and can thus be interpreted and related to the biological problem -- a crucial requirement for the bioinformatics and medical communities.",KDD
Active learning for biomedical citation screening,2010,"Active learning (AL) is an increasingly popular strategy for mitigating the amount of labeled data required to train classifiers, thereby reducing annotator effort. We describe a real-world, deployed application of AL to the problem of biomedical citation screening for systematic reviews at the Tufts Medical Center's Evidence-based Practice Center. We propose a novel active learning strategy that exploits a priori domain knowledge provided by the expert (specifically, labeled features)and extend this model via a Linear Programming algorithm for situations where the expert can provide ranked labeled features. Our methods outperform existing AL strategies on three real-world systematic review datasets. We argue that evaluation must be specific to the scenario under consideration. To this end, we propose a new evaluation framework for finite-pool scenarios, wherein the primary aim is to label a fixed set of examples rather than to simply induce a good predictive model. We use a method from medical decision theory for eliciting the relative costs of false positives and false negatives from the domain expert, constructing a utility measure of classification performance that integrates the expert preferences. Our findings suggest that the expert can, and should, provide more information than instance labels alone. In addition to achieving strong empirical results on the citation screening problem, this work outlines many important steps for moving away from simulated active learning and toward deploying AL for real-world applications.",KDD
Emergency Department Online Patient-Caregiver Scheduling,2019,"Emergency Departments (EDs) provide an imperative source of medical care. Central to the ED workflow is the patientcaregiver scheduling, directed at getting the right patient to the right caregiver at the right time. Unfortunately, common ED scheduling practices are based on ad-hoc heuristics which may not be aligned with the complex and partially conflicting ED's objectives. In this paper, we propose a novel online deep-learning scheduling approach for the automatic assignment and scheduling of medical personnel to arriving patients. Our approach allows for the optimization of explicit, hospital-specific multi-variate objectives and takes advantage of available data, without altering the existing workflow of the ED. In an extensive empirical evaluation, using real-world data, we show that our approach can significantly improve an ED's performance metrics.",AAAI
DeepHeart: Semi-Supervised Sequence Learning for Cardiovascular Risk Prediction,2018,"We train and validate a semi-supervised, multi-task LSTM on 57,675 person-weeks of data from off-the-shelf wearable heart rate sensors, showing high accuracy at detecting multiple medical conditions, including diabetes (0.8451), high cholesterol (0.7441), high blood pressure (0.8086), and sleep apnea (0.8298). We compare two semi-supervised training methods, semi-supervised sequence learning and heuristic pretraining, and show they outperform hand-engineered biomarkers from the medical literature. We believe our work suggests a new approach to patient risk stratification based on cardiovascular risk scores derived from popular wearables such as Fitbit, Apple Watch, or Android Wear.",AAAI
Evaluating Trauma Patients: Addressing Missing Covariates with Joint Optimization,2014,"Missing values are a common problem when applying classification algorithms to real-world medical data. This is especially true for trauma patients, where the emergent nature of the cases makes it difficult to collect all of the relevant data for each patient. Standard methods for handling missingness first learn a model to estimate missing data values, and subsequently train and evaluate a classifier using data imputed with this model. Recently, several proposed methods have demonstrated the benefits of jointly estimating the imputation model and classifier parameters. However, these methods make assumptions that limit their utility with many real-world medical datasets. For example, the assumption that data elements are missing at random is often invalid. We address this situation by exploring a novel approach for jointly learning the imputation model and classifier. Unlike previous algorithms, our approach makes no assumptions about the missingness of the data, can be used with arbitrary probabilistic data models and classification loss functions, and can be used when both the training and testing data have missing values. We investigate the utility of this approach on the prediction of several patient outcomes in a large national registry of trauma patients, and find that it significantly outperforms standard sequential methods.",AAAI
A Neural Multi-Task Learning Framework to Jointly Model Medical Named Entity Recognition and Normalization,2019,"State-of-the-art studies have demonstrated the superiority of joint modeling over pipeline implementation for medical named entity recognition and normalization due to the mutual benefits between the two processes. To exploit these benefits in a more sophisticated way, we propose a novel deep neural multi-task learning framework with explicit feedback strategies to jointly model recognition and normalization. On one hand, our method benefits from the general representations of both tasks provided by multi-task learning. On the other hand, our method successfully converts hierarchical tasks into a parallel multi-task setting while maintaining the mutual supports between tasks. Both of these aspects improve the model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method performs significantly better than state-of-theart approaches on two publicly available medical literature datasets.",AAAI
Multi-layer Representation Learning for Medical Concepts,2016,"Proper representations of medical concepts such as diagnosis, medication, procedure codes and visits from Electronic Health Records (EHR) has broad applications in healthcare analytics. Patient EHR data consists of a sequence of visits over time, where each visit includes multiple medical concepts, e.g., diagnosis, procedure, and medication codes. This hierarchical structure provides two types of relational information, namely sequential order of visits and co-occurrence of the codes within a visit. In this work, we propose Med2Vec, which not only learns the representations for both medical codes and visits from large EHR datasets with over million visits, but also allows us to interpret the learned representations confirmed positively by clinical experts. In the experiments, Med2Vec shows significant improvement in prediction accuracy in clinical applications compared to baselines such as Skip-gram, GloVe, and stacked autoencoder, while providing clinically meaningful interpretation.",KDD
Building Causal Graphs from Medical Literature and Electronic Medical Records,2019,"Large repositories of medical data, such as Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data, are recognized as promising sources for knowledge discovery. Effective analysis of such repositories often necessitate a thorough understanding of dependencies in the data. For example, if the patient age is ignored, then one might wrongly conclude a causal relationship between cataract and hypertension. Such confounding variables are often identified by causal graphs, where variables are connected by causal relationships. Current approaches to automatically building such graphs are based on text analysis over medical literature; yet, the result is typically a large graph of low precision. There are statistical methods for constructing causal graphs from observational data, but they are less suitable for dealing with a large number of covariates, which is the case in EMR data. Consequently, confounding variables are often identified by medical domain experts via a manual, expensive, and time-consuming process.",AAAI
Experiences with mining temporal event sequences from electronic medical records: initial successes and some challenges,2011,"The standardization and wider use of electronic medical records (EMR) creates opportunities for better understanding patterns of illness and care within and across medical systems. Our interest is in the temporal history of event codes embedded in patients' records, specifically investigating frequently occurring sequences of event codes across patients. In studying data from more than 1.6 million patient histories at the University of Michigan Health system we quickly realized that frequent sequences, while providing one level of data reduction, still constitute a serious analytical challenge as many involve alternate serializations of the same sets of codes. To further analyze these sequences, we designed an approach where a partial order is mined from frequent sequences of codes. We demonstrate an EMR mining system called EMRView that enables exploration of the precedence relationships to quickly identify and visualize partial order information encoded in key classes of patients. We demonstrate some important nuggets learned through our approach and also outline key challenges for future research based on our experiences.",KDD
Exploiting Sentence Embedding for Medical Question Answering,2019,"Despite the great success of word embedding, sentence embedding remains a not-well-solved problem. In this paper, we present a supervised learning framework to exploit sentence embedding for the medical question answering task. The learning framework consists of two main parts: 1) a sentence embedding producing module, and 2) a scoring module. The former is developed with contextual self-attention and multi-scale techniques to encode a sentence into an embedding tensor. This module is shortly called Contextual self-Attention Multi-scale Sentence Embedding (CAMSE). The latter employs two scoring strategies: Semantic Matching Scoring (SMS) and Semantic Association Scoring (SAS). SMS measures similarity while SAS captures association between sentence pairs: a medical question concatenated with a candidate choice, and a piece of corresponding supportive evidence. The proposed framework is examined by two Medical Question Answering(MedicalQA) datasets which are collected from real-world applications: medical exam and clinical diagnosis based on electronic medical records (EMR). The comparison results show that our proposed framework achieved significant improvements compared to competitive baseline approaches. Additionally, a series of controlled experiments are also conducted to illustrate that the multi-scale strategy and the contextual self-attention layer play important roles for producing effective sentence embedding, and the two kinds of scoring strategies are highly complementary to each other for question answering problems.",AAAI
Hierarchical Multi-Task Word Embedding Learning for Synonym Prediction,2019,"Automatic synonym recognition is of great importance for entity-centric text mining and interpretation. Due to the high language use variability in real-life, manual construction of semantic resources to cover all synonyms is prohibitively expensive and may also result in limited coverage. Although there are public knowledge bases, they only have limited coverage for languages other than English. In this paper, we focus on medical domain and propose an automatic way to accelerate the process of medical synonymy resource development for Chinese, including both formal entities from healthcare professionals and noisy descriptions from end-users. Motivated by the success of distributed word representations, we design a multi-task model with hierarchical task relationship to learn more representative entity/term embeddings and apply them to synonym prediction. In our model, we extend the classical skip-gram word embedding model by introducing an auxiliary task ""neighboring word semantic type prediction'' and hierarchically organize them based on the task complexity. Meanwhile, we incorporate existing medical term-term synonymous knowledge into our word embedding learning framework. We demonstrate that the embeddings trained from our proposed multi-task model yield significant improvement for entity semantic relatedness evaluation, neighboring word semantic type prediction and synonym prediction compared with baselines. Furthermore, we create a large medical text corpus in Chinese that includes annotations for entities, descriptions and synonymous pairs for future research in this direction.",KDD
Interpretable Representation Learning for Healthcare via Capturing Disease Progression through Time,2018,"Various deep learning models have recently been applied to predictive modeling of Electronic Health Records (EHR). In medical claims data, which is a particular type of EHR data, each patient is represented as a sequence of temporally ordered irregularly sampled visits to health providers, where each visit is recorded as an unordered set of medical codes specifying patient's diagnosis and treatment provided during the visit. Based on the observation that different patient conditions have different temporal progression patterns, in this paper we propose a novel interpretable deep learning model, called Timeline. The main novelty of Timeline is that it has a mechanism that learns time decay factors for every medical code. This allows the Timeline to learn that chronic conditions have a longer lasting impact on future visits than acute conditions. Timeline also has an attention mechanism that improves vector embeddings of visits. By analyzing the attention weights and disease progression functions of Timeline, it is possible to interpret the predictions and understand how risks of future visits change over time. We evaluated Timeline on two large-scale real world data sets. The specific task was to predict what is the primary diagnosis category for the next hospital visit given previous visits. Our results show that Timeline has higher accuracy than the state of the art deep learning models based on RNN. In addition, we demonstrate that time decay factors and attentions learned by Timeline are in accord with the medical knowledge and that Timeline can provide a useful insight into its predictions.",KDD
Medical Concept Embedding with Multiple Ontological Representations,2019,"Learning representations of medical concepts from the Electronic Health Records (EHR) has been shown effective for predictive analytics in healthcare. Incorporation of medical ontologies has also been explored to further enhance the accuracy and to ensure better alignment with the known medical knowledge. Most of the existing work assumes that medical concepts under the same ontological category should share similar representations, which however does not always hold. In particular, the categorizations in medical ontologies were established with various factors being considered. Medical concepts even under the same ontological category may not follow similar occurrence patterns in the EHR data, leading to contradicting objectives for the representation learning. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model called MMORE which alleviates this conflicting objective issue by allowing multiple representations to be inferred for each ontological category via an attention mechanism. We apply MMORE to diagnosis prediction and our experimental results show that the representations obtained by MMORE can achieve better predictive accuracy and result in clinically meaningful sub-categorization of the existing ontological categories.",IJCAI
Risk Prediction on Electronic Health Records with Prior Medical Knowledge,2018,"Predicting the risk of potential diseases from Electronic Health Records (EHR) has attracted considerable attention in recent years, especially with the development of deep learning techniques. Compared with traditional machine learning models, deep learning based approaches achieve superior performance on risk prediction task. However, none of existing work explicitly takes prior medical knowledge (such as the relationships between diseases and corresponding risk factors) into account. In medical domain, knowledge is usually represented by discrete and arbitrary rules. Thus, how to integrate such medical rules into existing risk prediction models to improve the performance is a challenge. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel and general framework called PRIME for risk prediction task, which can successfully incorporate discrete prior medical knowledge into all of the state-of-the-art predictive models using posterior regularization technique. Different from traditional posterior regularization, we do not need to manually set a bound for each piece of prior medical knowledge when modeling desired distribution of the target disease on patients. Moreover, the proposed PRIME can automatically learn the importance of different prior knowledge with a log-linear model.Experimental results on three real medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for the task of risk prediction",KDD
Automated Problem List Generation from Electronic Medical Records in IBM Watson,2015,"Identifying a patientÃ¢â¬â¢s important medical problems requires broad and deep medical expertise, as well as significant time to gather all the relevant facts from the patientÃ¢â¬â¢s medical record and assess the clinical importance of the facts in reaching the final conclusion. A patientÃ¢â¬â¢s medical problem list is by far the most critical information that a physician uses in treatment and care of a patient. In spite of its critical role, its curation, manual or automated, has been an unmet need in clinical practice. We developed a machine learning technique in IBM Watson to automatically generate a patientÃ¢â¬â¢s medical problem list. The machine learning model uses lexical and medical features extracted from a patientÃ¢â¬â¢s record using NLP techniques. We show that the automated method achieves 70% recall and 67% precision based on the gold standard that medical experts created on a set of de-identified patient records from a major hospital system in the US. To the best of our knowledge this is the first successful machine learning/NLP method of extracting an open-ended patientÃ¢â¬â¢s medical problems from an Electronic Medical Record (EMR).

DeepMood: Modeling Mobile Phone Typing Dynamics for Mood Detection,2017,"The increasing use of electronic forms of communication presents new opportunities in the study of mental health, including the ability to investigate the manifestations of psychiatric diseases unobtrusively and in the setting of patients' daily lives. A pilot study to explore the possible connections between bipolar affective disorder and mobile phone usage was conducted. In this study, participants were provided a mobile phone to use as their primary phone. This phone was loaded with a custom keyboard that collected metadata consisting of keypress entry time and accelerometer movement. Individual character data with the exceptions of the backspace key and space bar were not collected due to privacy concerns. We propose an end-to-end deep architecture based on late fusion, named DeepMood, to model the multi-view metadata for the prediction of mood scores. Experimental results show that 90.31% prediction accuracy on the depression score can be achieved based on session-level mobile phone typing dynamics which is typically less than one minute. It demonstrates the feasibility of using mobile phone metadata to infer mood disturbance and severity.",KDD
Learning Sleep Quality from Daily Logs,2019,"Precision psychiatry is a new research field that uses advanced data mining over a wide range of neural, behavioral, psychological, and physiological data sources for classification of mental health conditions. This study presents a computational framework for predicting sleep efficiency of insomnia sufferers. A smart band experiment is conducted to collect heterogeneous data, including sleep records, daily activities, and demographics, whose missing values are imputed via Improved Generative Adversarial Imputation Networks (Imp-GAIN). Equipped with the imputed data, we predict sleep efficiency of individual users with a proposed interpretable LSTM-Attention (LA Block) neural network model. We also propose a model, Pairwise Learning-based Ranking Generation (PLRG), to rank users with high insomnia potential in the next day. We discuss implications of our findings from the perspective of a psychiatric practitioner. Our computational framework can be used for other applications that analyze and handle noisy and incomplete time-series human activity data in the domain of precision psychiatry.",KDD
Mental Health In The Global South: Challenges And Opportunities In Hci For Development,2019,"Mental illness is rapidly gaining recognition as a serious global challenge. Recent human-computer interaction (HCI) research has investigated mental health as a domain of concern, but is yet to venture into the Global South, where the problem exhibits a more complex, intersectional nature. In this paper, we review work on mental health in the Global South and present a case for HCI for Development (HCI4D) to look at mental health-both because it is an inarguably important area of concern in itself, and also because it impacts the efficacy of HCI4D interventions in other domains. We consider the role of cultural and resource-based interactions towards accessibility challenges and continuing stigma around mental health. We also identify participants' mental health as a constant consideration for HCI4D and present best practices for measuring and incorporating it. As an example, we demonstrate how both the process and the lens of aspirations-based design, a recently proposed approach for HCI4D research and design, may benefit from the consideration of mental health concerns. Our paper thus recommends a path forward for considering mental health in HCI4D, potentially leading to new research directions in addition to enriching existing ones.",COMPASS
Modeling Situation Awareness in Human-Like Agents Using Mental Models,2011,"In order for agents to be able to act intelligently in an environment, a first necessary step is to become aware of the current situation in the environment. Forming such awareness is not a trivial matter. Appropriate observations should be selected by the agent, and the observation results should be interpreted and combined into one coherent picture. Humans use dedicated mental models which represent the relationships between various observations and the formation of beliefs about the environment, which then again direct the further observations to be performed. In this paper, a generic agent model for situation awareness is proposed that is able to take a mental model as input, and utilize this model to create a picture of the current situation. In order to show the suitability of the approach, it has been applied within the domain of F-16 fighter pilot training for which a dedicated mental model has been specified, and simulations experiments have been conducted.",IJCAI
Seasonal-adjustment Based Feature Selection Method for Predicting Epidemic with Large-scale Search Engine Logs,2019,"Search engine logs have a great potential in tracking and predicting outbreaks of infectious disease. More precisely, one can use the search volume of some search terms to predict the infection rate of an infectious disease in nearly real-time. However, conducting accurate and stable prediction of outbreaks using search engine logs is a challenging task due to the following two-way instability characteristics of the search logs. First, the search volume of a search term may change irregularly in the short-term, for example, due to environmental factors such as the amount of media or news. Second, the search volume may also change in the long-term due to the demographic change of the search engine. That is to say, if a model is trained with such search logs with ignoring such characteristic, the resulting prediction would contain serious mispredictions when these changes occur. In this work, we proposed a novel feature selection method to overcome this instability problem. In particular, we employ a seasonal-adjustment method that decomposes each time series into three components: seasonal, trend and irregular component and build prediction models for each component individually. We also carefully design a feature selection method to select proper search terms to predict each component. We conducted comprehensive experiments on ten different kinds of infectious diseases. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms all comparative methods in prediction accuracy for seven of ten diseases, in both now-casting and forecasting setting. Also, the proposed method is more successful in selecting search terms that are semantically related to target diseases.",KDD
Learning Credible Models,2018,"In many settings, it is important that a model be capable of providing reasons for its predictions (ÃÂ±e, the model must be interpretable). However, the model's reasoning may not conform with well-established knowledge. In such cases, while interpretable, the model lacks credibility. In this work, we formally define credibility in the linear setting and focus on techniques for learning models that are both accurate and credible. In particular, we propose a regularization penalty, expert yielded estimates (EYE), that incorporates expert knowledge about well-known relationships among covariates and the outcome of interest. We give both theoretical and empirical results comparing our proposed method to several other regularization techniques. Across a range of settings, experiments on both synthetic and real data show that models learned using the EYE penalty are significantly more credible than those learned using other penalties. Applied to two large-scale patient risk stratification task, our proposed technique results in a model whose top features overlap significantly with known clinical risk factors, while still achieving good predictive performance.",KDD
Factorized sparse learning models with interpretable high order feature interactions,2014,"Identifying interpretable discriminative high-order feature interactions given limited training data in high dimensions is challenging in both machine learning and data mining. In this paper, we propose a factorization based sparse learning framework termed FHIM for identifying high-order feature interactions in linear and logistic regression models, and study several optimization methods for solving them. Unlike previous sparse learning methods, our model FHIM recovers both the main effects and the interaction terms accurately without imposing tree-structured hierarchical constraints. Furthermore, we show that FHIM has oracle properties when extended to generalized linear regression models with pairwise interactions. Experiments on simulated data show that FHIM outperforms the state-of-the-art sparse lear-ning techniques. Further experiments on our experimentally generated data from patient blood samples using a novel SOMAmer (Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamer) technology show that, FHIM performs blood-based cancer diagnosis and bio-marker discovery for Renal Cell Carcinoma much better than other competing methods, and it identifies interpretable block-wise high-order gene interactions predictive of cancer stages of samples. A literature survey shows that the interactions identified by FHIM play important roles in cancer development.",KDD
Integrating Digital Pens in Breast Imaging for Instant Knowledge Acquisition,2013,"Future radiology practices assume that the radiology reports should be uniform, comprehensive, and easily managed. This means that reports must be ""readable"" to humans and machines alike. In order to improve reporting practices in breast imaging, we allow the radiologist to write structured reports with a special pen on paper with an invisible dot pattern. In this way, we provide a knowledge acquisition system for printed mammography patient forms for the combined work with printed and digital documents. In this domain, printed documents cannot be easily replaced by computer systems because they contain free-form sketches and textual annotations, and the acceptance of traditional PC reporting tools is rather low among the doctors. This is due to the fact that current electronic reporting systems significantly add to the amount of time it takes to complete the reports. We describe our real-time digital paper application and focus on the use case study of our deployed application. We think that our results motivate the design and implementation of intuitive pen based user interfaces for the medical reporting process and similar knowledge work domains. Our system imposes only minimal overhead on traditional form-filling processes and provides for a direct, ontology-based structuring of the user input for semantic search and retrieval applications, as well as other applied artificial intelligence scenarios which involve manual form-based data acquisition.",AAAI
On-line Recognition of Surgical Activity for Monitoring in the Operating Room,2008,"Surgery rooms are complex environments where many interactions take place between staff members and the electronic and mechanical systems. In spite of their inherent complexity, surgeries of the same kind bear numerous similarities and are usually performed with similar workflows. This gives the possibility to design support systems in the Operating Room (OR), whose applicability range from easy tasks such as the activation of OR lights and calling the next patient, to more complex ones such as context-sensitive user interfaces or automatic reporting. An essential feature when designing such systems, is the ability for on-line recognition of what is happening inside the OR, based on recorded signals. In this paper, we present an approach using signals from the OR and Hidden Markov Models to recognize on-line the surgical steps performed by the surgeon during a laparoscopic surgery. We also explain how the system can be deployed in the OR. Experiments are presented using 11 real surgeries performed by different surgeons in several ORs, recorded at our partner hospital. We believe that similar systems will quickly develop in the near future in order to efficiently support surgeons, trainees and the medical staff in general, as well as to improve administrative tasks like scheduling within hospitals.",AAAI
Pairwise-Ranking based Collaborative Recurrent Neural Networks for Clinical Event Prediction,2018,"Patient Electronic Health Records (EHR) data consist of sequences of patient visits over time. Sequential prediction of patients' future clinical events (e.g., diagnoses) from their historical EHR data is a core research task and motives a series of predictive models including deep learning. The existing research mainly adopts a classification framework, which treats the observed and unobserved events as positive and negative classes. However, this may not be true in real clinical setting considering the high rate of missed diagnoses and human errors. In this paper, we propose to formulate the clinical event prediction problem as an events recommendation problem. An end-to-end pairwise-ranking based collaborative recurrent neural networks (PacRNN) is proposed to solve it, which firstly embeds patient clinical contexts with attention RNN, then uses Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) regularized by disease co-occurrence to rank probabilities of patient-specific diseases, as well as use point process to provide simultaneous prediction of the occurring time of these diagnoses. Experimental results on two real world EHR datasets demonstrate the robust performance, interpretability, and efficacy of PacRNN.",IJCAI
Contextual Motifs: Increasing the Utility of Motifs using Contextual Data,2017,"Motifs are a powerful tool for analyzing physiological waveform data. Standard motif methods, however, ignore important contextual information (e.g., what the patient was doing at the time the data were collected). We hypothesize that these additional contextual data could increase the utility of motifs. Thus, we propose an extension to motifs, contextual motifs, that incorporates context. Recognizing that, oftentimes, context may be unobserved or unavailable, we focus on methods to jointly infer motifs and context. Applied to both simulated and real physiological data, our proposed approach improves upon existing motif methods in terms of the discriminative utility of the discovered motifs. In particular, we discovered contextual motifs in continuous glucose monitor (CGM) data collected from patients with type 1 diabetes. Compared to their contextless counterparts, these contextual motifs led to better predictions of hypo- and hyperglycemic events. Our results suggest that even when inferred, context is useful in both a long- and short-term prediction horizon when processing and interpreting physiological waveform data.",KDD
Sequential planning for steering immune system adaptation,2016,"Biological adaptation is a powerful mechanism that makes many disorders hard to combat. In this paper we study steering such adaptation through sequential planning. We propose a general approach where we leverage Monte Carlo tree search to compute a treatment plan, and the biological entity is modeled by a black-box simulator that the planner calls during planning. We show that the framework can be used to steer a biological entity modeled via a complex signaling pathway network that has numerous feedback loops that operate at different rates and have hard-to-understand aggregate behavior. We apply the framework to steering the adaptation of a patient's immune system. In particular, we apply it to a leading T cell simulator (available in the biological modeling package BioNetGen). We run experiments with two alternate goals: developing regulatory T cells or developing effector T cells. The former is important for preventing autoimmune diseases while the latter is associated with better survival rates in cancer patients. We are especially interested in the effect of sequential plans, an approach that has not been explored extensively in the biological literature. We show that for the development of regulatory cells, sequential plans yield significantly higher utility than the best static therapy. In contrast, for developing effector cells, we find that (at least for the given simulator, objective function, action possibilities, and measurement possibilities) single-step plans suffice for optimal treatment.",IJCAI
FutureMatch: Combining Human Value Judgments and Machine Learning to Match in Dynamic Environments,2015,"The preferred treatment for kidney failure is a transplant; however, demand for donor kidneys far outstrips supply. Kidney exchange, an innovation where willing but incompatible patient-donor pairs can exchange organs- Ã¢â¬â via barter cycles and altruist-initiated chains Ã¢â¬âprovides a life-saving alternative.Typically, fielded exchanges act myopically, considering only the current pool of pairs when planning the cycles and chains. Yet kidney exchange is inherently dynamic, with participants arriving and departing. Also, many planned exchange transplants do not go to surgery due to various failures. So, it is important to consider the future when matching. Motivated by our experience running the computational side of a large nationwide kidney exchange, we present FutureMatch, a framework for learning to match in a general dynamic model. FutureMatch takes as input a high-level objective (e.g., ""maximize graft survival of transplants over time'') decided on by experts, then automatically (i) learns based on data how to make this objective concrete and (ii) learns the ``means'' to accomplish this goal Ã¢â¬â a task, in our experience, that humans handle poorly. It uses data from all live kidney transplants in the US since 1987 to learn the quality of each possible match; it then learns the potentials of elements of the current input graph offline (e.g., potentials of pairs based on features such as donor and patient blood types), translates these to weights, and performs a computationally feasible batch matching that incorporates dynamic, failure-aware considerations through the weights. We validate FutureMatch on real fielded exchange data. It results in higher values of the objective. Furthermore, even under economically inefficient objectives that enforce equity, it yields better solutions for the efficient objective (which does not incorporate equity) than traditional myopic matching that uses the efficiency objective.",AAAI
TIARA: a visual exploratory text analytic system,2010,"In this paper, we present a novel exploratory visual analytic system called TIARA (Text Insight via Automated Responsive Analytics), which combines text analytics and interactive visualization to help users explore and analyze large collections of text. Given a collection of documents, TIARA first uses topic analysis techniques to summarize the documents into a set of topics, each of which is represented by a set of keywords. In addition to extracting topics, TIARA derives time-sensitive keywords to depict the content evolution of each topic over time. To help users understand the topic-based summarization results, TIARA employs several interactive text visualization techniques to explain the summarization results and seamlessly link such results to the original text. We have applied TIARA to several real-world applications, including email summarization and patient record analysis. To measure the effectiveness of TIARA, we have conducted several experiments. Our experimental results and initial user feedback suggest that TIARA is effective in aiding users in their exploratory text analytic tasks.",KDD
Discovering frequent patterns in sensitive data,2010,"Discovering frequent patterns from data is a popular exploratory technique in datamining. However, if the data are sensitive (e.g., patient health records, user behavior records) releasing information about significant patterns or trends carries significant risk to privacy. This paper shows how one can accurately discover and release the most significant patterns along with their frequencies in a data set containing sensitive information, while providing rigorous guarantees of privacy for the individuals whose information is stored there.
 We present two efficient algorithms for discovering the k most frequent patterns in a data set of sensitive records. Our algorithms satisfy differential privacy, a recently introduced definition that provides meaningful privacy guarantees in the presence of arbitrary external information. Differentially private algorithms require a degree of uncertainty in their output to preserve privacy. Our algorithms handle this by returning 'noisy' lists of patterns that are close to the actual list of k most frequent patterns in the data. We define a new notion of utility that quantifies the output accuracy of private top-k pattern mining algorithms. In typical data sets, our utility criterion implies low false positive and false negative rates in the reported lists. We prove that our methods meet the new utility criterion; we also demonstrate the performance of our algorithms through extensive experiments on the transaction data sets from the FIMI repository. While the paper focuses on frequent pattern mining, the techniques developed here are relevant whenever the data mining output is a list of elements ordered according to an appropriately 'robust' measure of interest.",KDD
"A Multivariate Timeseries Modeling Approach to Severity of Illness Assessment and Forecasting in ICU with Sparse, Heterogeneous Clinical Data",2015,"The ability to determine patient acuity (or severity of illness) has immediate practical use for clinicians. We evaluate the use of multivariate timeseries modeling with the multi-task Gaussian process (GP) models using noisy, incomplete, sparse, heterogeneous and unevenly-sampled clinical data, including both physiological signals and clinical notes. The learned multi-task GP (MTGP) hyperparameters are then used to assess and forecast patient acuity. Experiments were conducted with two real clinical data sets acquired from ICU patients: firstly, estimating cerebrovascular pressure reactivity, an important indicator of secondary damage for traumatic brain injury patients, by learning the interactions between intracranial pressure and mean arterial blood pressure signals, and secondly, mortality prediction using clinical progress notes. In both cases, MTGPs provided improved results: an MTGP model provided better results than single-task GP models for signal interpolation and forecasting (0.91 vs 0.69 RMSE), and the use of MTGP hyperparameters obtained improved results when used as additional classification features (0.812 vs 0.788 AUC).",AAAI
SUSTain: Scalable Unsupervised Scoring for Tensors and its Application to Phenotyping,2018,"This paper presents a new method, which we call SUSTain, that extends real-valued matrix and tensor factorizations to data where values are integers. Such data are common when the values correspond to event counts or ordinal measures. The conventional approach is to treat integer data as real, and then apply real-valued factorizations. However, doing so fails to preserve important characteristics of the original data, thereby making it hard to interpret the results. Instead, our approach extracts factor values from integer datasets as scores that are constrained to take values from a small integer set. These scores are easy to interpret: a score of zero indicates no feature contribution and higher scores indicate distinct levels of feature importance. At its core, SUSTain relies on: a) a problem partitioning into integer-constrained subproblems, so that they can be optimally solved in an efficient manner; and b) organizing the order of the subproblems' solution, to promote reuse of shared intermediate results. We propose two variants, SUSTain_M and SUSTain_T, to handle both matrix and tensor inputs, respectively. We evaluate SUSTain against several state-of-the-art baselines on both synthetic and real Electronic Health Record (EHR) datasets. Comparing to those baselines, SUSTain shows either significantly better fit or orders of magnitude speedups that achieve a comparable fit (up to 425Ãâ faster). We apply SUSTain to EHR datasets to extract patient phenotypes (i.e., clinically meaningful patient clusters). Furthermore, 87% of them were validated as clinically meaningful phenotypes related to heart failure by a cardiologist.",KDD
A Robust Framework for Accelerated Outcome-driven Risk Factor Identification from EHR,2019,"Electronic Health Records (EHR) containing longitudinal information about millions of patient lives are increasingly being utilized by organizations across the healthcare spectrum. Studies on EHR data have enabled real world applications like understanding of disease progression, outcomes analysis, and comparative effectiveness research. However, often every study is independently commissioned, data is gathered by surveys or specifically purchased per study by a long and often painful process. This is followed by an arduous repetitive cycle of analysis, model building, and generation of insights. This process can take anywhere between 1 - 3 years. In this paper, we present a robust end-to-end machine learning based SaaS system to perform analysis on a very large EHR dataset. The framework consists of a proprietary EHR datamart spanning ~55 million patient lives in USA and over ~20 billion data points. To the best of our knowledge, this framework is the largest in the industry to analyze medical records at this scale, with such efficacy and ease. We developed an end-to-end ML framework with carefully chosen components to support EHR analysis at scale and suitable for further downstream clinical analysis. Specifically, it consists of a ridge regularized Survival Support Vector Machine (SSVM) with a clinical kernel, coupled with Chi-square distance-based feature selection, to uncover relevant risk factors by exploiting the weak correlations in EHR. Our results on multiple real use cases indicate that the framework identifies relevant factors effectively without expert supervision. The framework is stable, generalizable over outcomes, and also found to contribute to better out-of-bound prediction over known expert features. Importantly, the ML methodologies used are interpretable which is critical for acceptance of our system in the targeted user base. With the system being operational, all of these studies were completed within a time frame of 3-4 weeks compared to the industry standard 12-36 months. As such our system can accelerate analysis and discovery, result in better ROI due to reduced investments as well as quicker turn around of studies.",KDD
Dynamically Modeling Patient's Health State from Electronic Medical Records: A Time Series Approach,2015,"In this paper, we present a method to dynamically estimate the probability of mortality inside the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) by combining heterogeneous data. We propose a method based on Generalized Linear Dynamic Models that models the probability of mortality as a latent state that evolves over time. This framework allows us to combine different types of features (lab results, vital signs readings, doctor and nurse notes, etc) into a single state, which is updated each time new patient data is observed. In addition, we include the use of text features, based on medical noun phrase extraction and Statistical Topic Models. These features provide context about the patient that cannot be captured when only numerical features are used. We fill out the missing values using a Regularized Expectation Maximization based method assuming temporal data. We test our proposed approach using 15,000 Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) obtained from the MIMIC II public dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed model allows us to detect an increase in the probability of mortality before it occurs. We report an AUC 0.8657. Our proposed model clearly outperforms other methods of the literature in terms of sensitivity with 0.7885 compared to 0.6559 of Naive Bayes and F-score with 0.5929 compared to 0.4662 of Apache III score after 24 hours.",KDD
Medical coding classification by leveraging inter-code relationships,2010,"Medical coding or classification is the process of transforming information contained in patient medical records into standard predefined medical codes. There are several worldwide accepted medical coding conventions associated with diagnoses and medical procedures; however, in the United States the Ninth Revision of ICD(ICD-9) provides the standard for coding clinical records. Accurate medical coding is important since it is used by hospitals for insurance billing purposes. Since after discharge a patient can be assigned or classified to several ICD-9 codes, the coding problem can be seen as a multi-label classification problem. In this paper, we introduce a multi-label large-margin classifier that automatically learns the underlying inter-code structure and allows the controlled incorporation of prior knowledge about medical code relationships. In addition to refining and learning the code relationships, our classifier can also utilize this shared information to improve its performance. Experiments on a publicly available dataset containing clinical free text and their associated medical codes showed that our proposed multi-label classifier outperforms related multi-label models in this problem.",KDD
Predicting ICU Mortality Risk by Grouping Temporal Trends from a Multivariate Panel of Physiologic Measurements,2016,"ICU mortality risk prediction may help clinicians take effective interventions to improve patient outcome. Existing machine learning approaches often face challenges in integrating a comprehensive panel of physiologic variables and presenting to clinicians interpretable models. We aim to improve both accuracy and interpretability of prediction models by introducing Subgraph Augmented Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SANMF) on ICU physiologic time series. SANMF converts time series into a graph representation and applies frequent subgraph mining to automatically extract temporal trends. We then apply non-negative matrix factorization to group trends in a way that approximates patient pathophysiologic states. Trend groups are then used as features in training a logistic regression model for mortality risk prediction, and are also ranked according to their contribution to mortality risk. We evaluated SANMF against four empirical models on the task of predicting mortality or survival 30 days after discharge from ICU using the observed physiologic measurements between 12 and 24 hours after admission. SANMF outperforms all comparison models, and in particular, demonstrates an improvement in AUC (0.848 vs. 0.827, p<0.002) compared to a state-of-the-art machine learning method that uses manual feature engineering. Feature analysis was performed to illuminate insights and benefits of subgraph groups in mortality risk prediction.",AAAI
Simultaneous Prediction Intervals for Patient-Specific Survival Curves,2019,"Accurate models of patient survival probabilities provide important information to clinicians prescribing care for life-threatening and terminal ailments. A recently developed class of models -- known as individual survival distributions (ISDs) -- produces patient-specific survival functions that offer greater descriptive power of patient outcomes than was previously possible. Unfortunately, at the time of writing, ISD models almost universally lack uncertainty quantification. In this paper we demonstrate that an existing method for estimating simultaneous prediction intervals from samples can easily be adapted for patient-specific survival curve analysis and yields accurate results. Furthermore, we introduce both a modification to the existing method and a novel method for estimating simultaneous prediction intervals and show that they offer competitive performance. It is worth emphasizing that these methods are not limited to survival analysis and can be applied in any context in which sampling the distribution of interest is tractable. Code is available at https://github.com/ssokota/spie.",IJCAI
CounterFactual Regression with Importance Sampling Weights,2019,"Perhaps the most pressing concern of a patient diagnosed with cancer is her life expectancy under various treatment options. For a binary-treatment case, this translates into estimating the difference between the outcomes (e.g., survival time) of the two available treatment options Ã¢â¬â i.e., her Individual Treatment Effect (ITE). This is especially challenging to estimate from observational data, as that data has selection bias: the treatment assigned to a patient depends on that patient's attributes. In this work, we borrow ideas from domain adaptation to address the distributional shift between the source (outcome of the administered treatment, appearing in the observed training data) and target (outcome of the alternative treatment) that exists due to selection bias. We propose a context-aware importance sampling re-weighing scheme, built on top of a representation learning module, for estimating ITEs. Empirical results on two publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art.",IJCAI
Unfolding physiological state: mortality modelling in intensive care units,2014,"Accurate knowledge of a patient's disease state and trajectory is critical in a clinical setting. Modern electronic healthcare records contain an increasingly large amount of data, and the ability to automatically identify the factors that influence patient outcomes stand to greatly improve the efficiency and quality of care.
 We examined the use of latent variable models (viz. Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to decompose free-text hospital notes into meaningful features, and the predictive power of these features for patient mortality. We considered three prediction regimes: (1) baseline prediction, (2) dynamic (time-varying) outcome prediction, and (3) retrospective outcome prediction. In each, our prediction task differs from the familiar time-varying situation whereby data accumulates; since fewer patients have long ICU stays, as we move forward in time fewer patients are available and the prediction task becomes increasingly difficult.
 We found that latent topic-derived features were effective in determining patient mortality under three timelines: in-hospital, 30 day post-discharge, and 1 year post-discharge mortality. Our results demonstrated that the latent topic features important in predicting hospital mortality are very different from those that are important in post-discharge mortality. In general, latent topic features were more predictive than structured features, and a combination of the two performed best.
 The time-varying models that combined latent topic features and baseline features had AUCs that reached 0.85, 0.80, and 0.77 for in-hospital, 30 day post-discharge and 1 year post-discharge mortality respectively. Our results agreed with other work suggesting that the first 24 hours of patient information are often the most predictive of hospital mortality. Retrospective models that used a combination of latent topic features and structured features achieved AUCs of 0.96, 0.82, and 0.81 for in-hospital, 30 day, and 1-year mortality prediction.
 Our work focuses on the dynamic (time-varying) setting because models from this regime could facilitate an on-going severity stratification system that helps direct care-staff resources and inform treatment strategies.",KDD
Joint Learning of Phenotypes and Diagnosis-Medication Correspondence via Hidden Interaction Tensor Factorization,2018,"Non-negative tensor factorization has been shown effective for discovering phenotypes from the EHR data with minimal human supervision. In most cases, an interaction tensor of the elements in the EHR (e.g., diagnoses and medications) has to be first established before the factorization can be applied. Such correspondence information however is often missing. While different heuristics can be used to estimate the missing correspondence, any errors introduced will in turn cause inaccuracy for the subsequent phenotype discovery task. This is especially true for patients with multiple diseases diagnosed (e.g., under critical care). To alleviate this limitation, we propose the hidden interaction tensor factorization (HITF) where the diagnosis-medication correspondence and the underlying phenotypes are inferred simultaneously. We formulate it under a Poisson non-negative tensor factorization framework and learn the HITF model via maximum likelihood estimation. For performance evaluation, we applied HITF to the MIMIC III dataset. Our empirical results show that both the phenotypes and the correspondence inferred are clinically meaningful. In addition, the inferred HITF model outperforms a number of state-of-the-art methods for mortality prediction.",IJCAI
Clinical risk prediction with multilinear sparse logistic regression,2014,"Logistic regression is one core predictive modeling technique that has been used extensively in health and biomedical problems. Recently a lot of research has been focusing on enforcing sparsity on the learned model to enhance its effectiveness and interpretability, which results in sparse logistic regression model. However, no matter the original or sparse logistic regression, they require the inputs to be in vector form. This limits the applicability of logistic regression in the problems when the data cannot be naturally represented vectors (e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography signals). To handle the cases when the data are in the form of multi-dimensional arrays, we propose MulSLR: Multilinear Sparse Logistic Regression. MulSLR can be viewed as a high order extension of sparse logistic regression. Instead of solving one classification vector as in conventional logistic regression, we solve for K classification vectors in MulSLR (K is the number of modes in the data). We propose a block proximal descent approach to solve the problem and prove its convergence. The convergence rate of the proposed algorithm is also analyzed. Finally we validate the efficiency and effectiveness of MulSLR on predicting the onset risk of patients with Alzheimer's disease and heart failure.",KDD
Preventing Infectious Disease in Dynamic Populations Under Uncertainty,2018,"Treatable infectious diseases are a critical challenge for public health. Outreach campaigns can encourage undiagnosed patients to seek treatment but must be carefully targeted to make the most efficient use of limited resources. We present an algorithm to optimally allocate limited outreach resources among demographic groups in the population. The algorithm uses a novel multiagent model of disease spread which both captures the underlying population dynamics and is amenable to optimization. Our algorithm extends, with provable guarantees, to a stochastic setting where we have only a distribution over parameters such as the contact pattern between agents. We evaluate our algorithm on two instances where this distribution is inferred from real world data: tuberculosis in India and gonorrhea in the United States. Our algorithm produces a policy which is predicted to avert an average of least 8,000 person-years of tuberculosis and 20,000 person-years of gonorrhea annually compared to current policy.",AAAI
Multi-source learning for joint analysis of incomplete multi-modality neuroimaging data,2012,"Incomplete data present serious problems when integrating large-scale brain imaging data sets from different imaging modalities. In the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), for example, over half of the subjects lack cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurements; an independent half of the subjects do not have fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans; many lack proteomics measurements. Traditionally, subjects with missing measures are discarded, resulting in a severe loss of available information. We address this problem by proposing two novel learning methods where all the samples (with at least one available data source) can be used. In the first method, we divide our samples according to the availability of data sources, and we learn shared sets of features with state-of-the-art sparse learning methods. Our second method learns a base classifier for each data source independently, based on which we represent each source using a single column of prediction scores; we then estimate the missing prediction scores, which, combined with the existing prediction scores, are used to build a multi-source fusion model. To illustrate the proposed approaches, we classify patients from the ADNI study into groups with Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and normal controls, based on the multi-modality data. At baseline, ADNI's 780 participants (172 AD, 397 MCI, 211 Normal), have at least one of four data types: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), FDG-PET, CSF and proteomics. These data are used to test our algorithms. Comprehensive experiments show that our proposed methods yield stable and promising results.",KDD
Unsupervised learning of disease progression models,2014,"Chronic diseases, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Diabetes, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, usually progress slowly over a long period of time, causing increasing burden to the patients, their families, and the healthcare system. A better understanding of their progression is instrumental in early diagnosis and personalized care. Modeling disease progression based on real-world evidence is a very challenging task due to the incompleteness and irregularity of the observations, as well as the heterogeneity of the patient conditions. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic disease progression model that address these challenges. As compared to existing disease progression models, the advantage of our model is three-fold: 1) it learns a continuous-time progression model from discrete-time observations with non-equal intervals; 2) it learns the full progression trajectory from a set of incomplete records that only cover short segments of the progression; 3) it learns a compact set of medical concepts as the bridge between the hidden progression process and the observed medical evidence, which are usually extremely sparse and noisy. We demonstrate the capabilities of our model by applying it to a real-world COPD patient cohort and deriving some interesting clinical insights.",KDD
Scalable Robust Kidney Exchange,2019,"In barter exchanges, participants directly trade their endowed goods in a constrained economic setting without money. Transactions in barter exchanges are often facilitated via a central clearinghouse that must match participants even in the face of uncertaintyÃ¢â¬âover participants, existence and quality of potential trades, and so on. Leveraging robust combinatorial optimization techniques, we address uncertainty in kidney exchange, a real-world barter market where patients swap (in)compatible paired donors. We provide two scalable robust methods to handle two distinct types of uncertainty in kidney exchangeÃ¢â¬âover the quality and the existence of a potential match. The latter case directly addresses a weakness in all stochastic-optimization-based methods to the kidney exchange clearing problem, which all necessarily require explicit estimates of the probability of a transaction existingÃ¢â¬âa still-unsolved problem in this nascent market. We also propose a novel, scalable kidney exchange formulation that eliminates the need for an exponential-time constraint generation process in competing formulations, maintains provable optimality, and serves as a subsolver for our robust approach. For each type of uncertainty we demonstrate the benefits of robustness on real data from a large, fielded kidney exchange in the United States. We conclude by drawing parallels between robustness and notions of fairness in the kidney exchange setting.",AAAI
ICU Mortality Prediction: A Classification Algorithm for Imbalanced Datasets,2017,"Determining mortality risk is important for critical decisions in Intensive Care Units (ICU). The need for machine learning models that provide accurate patient-specific prediction of mortality is well recognized. We present a new algorithm for ICU mortality prediction that is designed to address the problem of imbalance, which occurs, in the context of binary classification, when one of the two classes is significantly under--represented in the data. We take a fundamentally new approach in exploiting the class imbalance through a feature transformation such that the transformed features are easier to classify. Hypothesis testing is used for classification with a test statistic that follows the distribution of the difference of two chi-squared random variables, for which there are no analytic expressions and we derive an accurate approximation. Experiments on a benchmark dataset of 4000 ICU patients show that our algorithm surpasses the best competing methods for mortality prediction.",AAAI
Discovery of Glaucoma Progressive Patterns Using Hierarchical MDL-Based Clustering,2015,"In this paper, we propose a method to cluster the spacial patterns of the visual field in glaucoma patients to analyze the progression patterns of glaucoma. The degree of progression in the visual field of glaucoma patients can be divided into several regions by straight line boundaries, we call this specific structure Direct Product Structure in this paper. Since we can observe the direct product structure in the visual fields, we propose a bottom-up hierarchical clustering method to embed this structure into the clustering structure. In our method, according to the minimum description length (MDL) principle, we select the best cluster division so that the total code length required for encoding the data as well as the clustering structure is minimum. We can thereby select the clusters that are robust to the noise in the position of the direct product structure for clustering. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using an artificial dataset and a real glaucoma dataset. Our proposed method performed better than existing methods for both datasets. For the real glaucoma dataset in particular, our method discovered the characteristic progressive patterns of glaucoma as specific features of clusters. These patterns agree with clinical knowledge. Furthermore, we show that our clusters can be applied to improve the accuracy of predicting glaucoma progression. Thus, our clusters contain rich information of glaucoma, and hence can contribute to further development in glaucoma research.",KDD
Dipole: Diagnosis Prediction in Healthcare via Attention-based Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks,2017,"Predicting the future health information of patients from the historical Electronic Health Records (EHR) is a core research task in the development of personalized healthcare. Patient EHR data consist of sequences of visits over time, where each visit contains multiple medical codes, including diagnosis, medication, and procedure codes. The most important challenges for this task are to model the temporality and high dimensionality of sequential EHR data and to interpret the prediction results. Existing work solves this problem by employing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model EHR data and utilizing simple attention mechanism to interpret the results. However, RNN-based approaches suffer from the problem that the performance of RNNs drops when the length of sequences is large, and the relationships between subsequent visits are ignored by current RNN-based approaches. To address these issues, we propose Dipole, an end-to-end, simple and robust model for predicting patients' future health information. Dipole employs bidirectional recurrent neural networks to remember all the information of both the past visits and the future visits, and it introduces three attention mechanisms to measure the relationships of different visits for the prediction. With the attention mechanisms, Dipole can interpret the prediction results effectively. Dipole also allows us to interpret the learned medical code representations which are confirmed positively by medical experts. Experimental results on two real world EHR datasets show that the proposed Dipole can significantly improve the prediction accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art diagnosis prediction approaches and provide clinically meaningful interpretation.",KDD
Dynamic Hierarchical Classification for Patient Risk-of-Readmission,2015,"Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) is a serious chronic condition often leading to 50% mortality within 5 years. Improper treatment and post-discharge care of CHF patients leads to repeat frequent hospitalizations (i.e., readmissions). Accurately predicting patient's risk-of-readmission enables care-providers to plan resources, perform factor analysis, and improve patient quality of life. In this paper, we describe a supervised learning framework, Dynamic Hierarchical Classification (DHC) for patient's risk-of-readmission prediction. Learning the hierarchy of classifiers is often the most challenging component of such classification schemes. The novelty of our approach is to algorithmically generate various layers and combine them to predict overall 30-day risk-of-readmission. While the components of DHC are generic, in this work, we focus on congestive heart failure (CHF), a pressing chronic condition. Since healthcare data is diverse and rich and each source and feature-subset provides different insights into a complex problem, our DHC based prediction approach intelligently leverages each source and feature-subset to optimize different objectives (such as, Recall or AUC) for CHF risk-of-readmission. DHC's algorithmic layering capability is trained and tested over two real world datasets and is currently integrated into the clinical decision support tools at MultiCare Health System (MHS), a major provider of healthcare services in the northwestern US. It is integrated into a QlikView App (with EMR integration planned for Q2) and currently scores patients everyday, helping to mitigate readmissions and improve quality of care, leading to healthier outcomes and cost savings.",KDD
Adaptive Treatment of Epilepsy via Batch-mode Reinforcement Learning,2008,"This paper highlights the crucial role that modern machine learning techniques can play in the optimization of treatment strategies for patients with chronic disorders. In particular, we focus on the task of optimizing a deep-brain stimulation strategy for the treatment of epilepsy. The challenge is to choose which stimulation action to apply, as a function of the observed EEG signal, so as to minimize the frequency and duration of seizures. We apply recent techniques from the reinforcement learning literatureânamely fitted Q-iteration and extremely randomized treesâto learn an optimal stimulation policy using labeled training data from animal brain tissues. Our results show that these methods are an effective means of reducing the incidence of seizures, while also minimizing the amount of stimulation applied. If these results carry over to the human model of epilepsy, the impact for patients will be substantial.",AAAI
Predict Risk of Relapse for Patients with Multiple Stages of Treatment of Depression,2016,"Depression is a serious mood disorder afflicting millions of people around the globe. Medications of different types and with different effects on neural activity have been developed for its treatments during the past few decades. Due to the heterogeneity of the disorder, many patients cannot achieve symptomatic remission from a single clinical trial. Instead they need multiple clinical trials to achieve remission, resulting in a multiple stage treatment pattern. Furthermore those who indeed achieve symptom remission are still faced with substantial risk of relapse. One promising approach to predicting the risk of relapse is censored regression. Traditional censored regression typically applies only to situations in which the exact time of event of interest is known. However, follow-up studies that track the patients' relapse status can only provide an interval of time during which relapse occurs. The exact time of relapse is usually unknown. In this paper, we present a censored regression approach with a truncated $l_1$ loss function that can handle the uncertainty of relapse time. Based on this general loss function, we develop a gradient boosting algorithm and a stochastic dual coordinate ascent algorithm when the hypothesis in the loss function is represented as (1) an ensemble of decision trees and (2) a linear combination of covariates, respectively. As an extension of our linear model, a multi-stage linear approach is further proposed to harness the data collected from multiple stages of treatment. We evaluate the proposed algorithms using a real-world clinical trial dataset. Results show that our methods outperform the well-known Cox proportional hazard model. In addition, the risk factors identified by our multi-stage linear model not only corroborate findings from recent research but also yield some new insights into how to develop effective measures for prevention of relapse among patients after their initial remission from the acute treatment stage.",KDD
Forecasting Potential Diabetes Complications,2014,"Diabetes complications often afflict diabetes patients seriously: over 68% of diabetes-related mortality is caused by diabetes complications. In this paper, we study the problem of automatically diagnosing diabetes complications from patients' lab test results. The objective problem has two main challenges: 1) feature sparseness: a patient only undergoes 1.26% lab tests on average, and 65.5% types of lab tests are performed on samples from less than 10 patients; 2) knowledge skewness: it lacks comprehensive detailed domain knowledge of the association between diabetes complications and lab tests. To address these challenges, we propose a novel probabilistic model called Sparse Factor Graph Model (SparseFGM). SparseFGM projects sparse features onto a lower-dimensional latent space, which alleviates the problem of sparseness. SparseFGM is also able to capture the associations between complications and lab tests, which help handle the knowledge skewness. We evaluate the proposed model on a large collections of real medical records. SparseFGM outperforms (+20% by F1) baselines significantly and gives detailed associations between diabetes complications and lab tests.",AAAI
ReAl-LiFE: Accelerating the Discovery of Individualized Brain Connectomes on GPUs,2019,"Diffusion imaging and tractography enable mapping structural connections in the human brain, in-vivo. Linear Fascicle Evaluation (LiFE) is a state-of-the-art approach for pruning spurious connections in the estimated structural connectome, by optimizing its fit to the measured diffusion data. Yet, LiFE imposes heavy demands on computing time, precluding its use in analyses of large connectome databases. Here, we introduce a GPU-based implementation of LiFE that achieves 50-100x speedups over conventional CPU-based implementations for connectome sizes of up to several million fibers. Briefly, the algorithm accelerates generalized matrix multiplications on a compressed tensor through efficient GPU kernels, while ensuring favorable memory access patterns. Leveraging these speedups, we advance LiFEÃ¢â¬â¢s algorithm by imposing a regularization constraint on estimated fiber weights during connectome pruning. Our regularized, accelerated, LiFE algorithm (Ã¢â¬ÅReAl-LiFEÃ¢â¬Â) estimates sparser connectomes that also provide more accurate fits to the underlying diffusion signal. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by classifying pathological signatures of structural connectivity in patients with AlzheimerÃ¢â¬â¢s Disease (AD). We estimated million fiber whole-brain connectomes, followed by pruning with ReAl-LiFE, for 90 individuals (45 AD patients and 45 healthy controls). Linear classifiers, based on support vector machines, achieved over 80% accuracy in classifying AD patients from healthy controls based on their ReAl-LiFE pruned structural connectomes alone. Moreover, classification based on the ReAl-LiFE pruned connectome outperformed both the unpruned connectome, as well as the LiFE pruned connectome, in terms of accuracy. We propose our GPU-accelerated approach as a widely relevant tool for non-negative least squares optimization, across many domains.",AAAI
Patient Subtyping via Time-Aware LSTM Networks,2017,"In the study of various diseases, heterogeneity among patients usually leads to different progression patterns and may require different types of therapeutic intervention. Therefore, it is important to study patient subtyping, which is grouping of patients into disease characterizing subtypes. Subtyping from complex patient data is challenging because of the information heterogeneity and temporal dynamics. Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) has been successfully used in many domains for processing sequential data, and recently applied for analyzing longitudinal patient records. The LSTM units are designed to handle data with constant elapsed times between consecutive elements of a sequence. Given that time lapse between successive elements in patient records can vary from days to months, the design of traditional LSTM may lead to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel LSTM unit called Time-Aware LSTM (T-LSTM) to handle irregular time intervals in longitudinal patient records. We learn a subspace decomposition of the cell memory which enables time decay to discount the memory content according to the elapsed time. We propose a patient subtyping model that leverages the proposed T-LSTM in an auto-encoder to learn a powerful single representation for sequential records of patients, which are then used to cluster patients into clinical subtypes. Experiments on synthetic and real world datasets show that the proposed T-LSTM architecture captures the underlying structures in the sequences with time irregularities.",KDD
Simultaneous Modeling of Multiple Diseases for Mortality Prediction in Acute Hospital Care,2015,"Acute hospital care as performed in the intensive care unit (ICU) is characterized by its frequent, but short-term interventions for patients who are severely ill. Because clinicians have to attend to more than one patient at a time and make decisions in a limited time in acute hospital care environments, the accurate prediction of the in-hospital mortality risk could assist them to pay more attention to patients with a higher in-hospital mortality risk, thereby improving the quality and efficiency of the care. One of the salient features of ICU is the diversity of patients: clinicians are faced by patients with a wide variety of diseases. However, mortality prediction for ICU patients has typically been conducted by building one common predictive model for all the diseases. In this paper, we incorporate disease-specific contexts into mortality modeling by formulating the mortality prediction problem as a multi-task learning problem in which a task corresponds to a disease. Our method effectively integrates medical domain knowledge relating to the similarity among diseases and the similarity among Electronic Health Records (EHRs) into a data-driven approach by incorporating graph Laplacians into the regularization term to encode these similarities. The experimental results on a real dataset from a hospital corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The AUCs of several baselines were improved, including logistic regression without multi-task learning and several multi-task learning methods that do not incorporate the domain knowledge. In addition, we illustrate some interesting results pertaining to disease-specific predictive features, some of which are not only consistent with existing medical domain knowledge, but also contain suggestive hypotheses that could be validated by further investigations in the medical domain.",KDD
A Non-parametric Approach to Detect Epileptogenic Lesions using Restricted Boltzmann Machines,2016,"Visual detection of lesional areas on a cortical surface is critical in rendering a successful surgical operation for Treatment Resistant Epilepsy (TRE) patients. Unfortunately, 45% of Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD, the most common kind of TRE) patients have no visual abnormalities in their brains' 3D-MRI images. We collaborate with doctors from NYU Langone's Comprehensive Epilepsy Center and apply machine learning methodologies to identify the resective zones for these {MRI-negative} FCD patients. Our task is particularly challenging because MRI images can only provide a limited number of features. Furthermore, data from different patients often exhibit inter-patient variabilities due to age, gender, left/right handedness, etc. In this paper, we introduce a new approach which combines the restricted Boltzmann machines and a Bayesian non-parametric mixture model to address these issues. We demonstrate the efficacy of our model by applying it to a retrospective dataset of MRI-negative FCD patients who are seizure free after surgery.",KDD
Predicting Postoperative Atrial Fibrillation from Independent ECG Components,2014,"Postoperative atrial fibrillation (PAF) occurs in 10% to 65% of the patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery. It is associated with increased post-surgical mortality and morbidity, and results in longer and more expensive hospital stays. Accurately stratifying patients for PAF allows for selective use of prophylactic therapies (e.g., amiodarone). Unfortunately, existing tools to stratify patients for PAF fail to provide clinically adequate discrimination. Our research addresses this situation through the development of novel electrocardiographic(ECG) markers to identify patients at risk of PAF. As a first step, we explore an eigen-decomposition approach that partitions ECG signals into atrial and ventricular components by exploiting knowledge of the underlying cardiac cycle. We then quantify electrical instability in the myocardium manifesting as probabilistic variations in atrial ECG morphology to assess therisk of PAF. When evaluated on 385 patients undergoing cardiac surgery, this approach of stratifying patients for PAF through an analysis of morphologic variability within decoupled atrial ECG demonstrated substantial promise and improved net reclassification by over 53% relative to the use of baseline clinical characteristics.",AAAI
Learning Differences Between Visual Scanning Patterns Can Disambiguate Bipolar and Unipolar Patients,2018,"Bipolar Disorder (BD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) are two common and debilitating mood disorders. Misdiagnosing BD as MDD is relatively common and the introduction of markers to improve diagnostic accuracy early in the course of the illness has been identified as one of the top unmet needs in the field. In this paper, we present novel methods to differentiate between BD and MDD patients. The methods use deep learning techniques to quantify differences between visual scanning patterns of BD and MDD patients. In the methods, visual scanning patterns that are described by ordered sequences of fixations on emotional faces are encoded into a lower dimensional space and are fed into a long-short term memory recurrent neural network (RNN). Fixation sequences are encoded by three different methods: 1) using semantic regions of interests (RoIs) that are manually defined by experts, 2) using semi-automatically defined grids of RoIs, or 3) using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically extract visual features from saliency maps. Using data from 47 patients with MDD and 26 patients with BD we showed that using semantic RoIs, the RNN improved the performance of a baseline classifier from an AUC of 0.603 to an AUC of 0.878. Similarly using grid RoIs, the RNN improved the performance of a baseline classifier from an AUC of 0.450 to an AUC of 0.828. The classifier that automatically extracted visual features from saliency maps (a long recurrent convolutional network that is fully data-driven) had an AUC of 0.879. The results of the study suggest that by using RNNs to learn differences between fixation sequences the diagnosis of individual patients with BD or MDD can be disambiguated with high accuracy. Moreover, by using saliency maps and CNN to encode the fixation sequences the method can be fully automated and achieve high accuracy without relying on user expertise and/or manual labelling. When compared with other markers, the performance of the class of classifiers that was introduced in this paper is better than that of detectors that use differences in neural structures, neural activity or cortical hemodynamics to differentiate between BD and MDD patients. The novel use of RNNs to quantify differences between fixation sequences of patients with mood disorders can be easily generalized to studies of other neuropsychological disorders and to other fields such as psychology and advertising.",AAAI
Detection of Apathy in Alzheimer Patients by Analysing Visual Scanning Behaviour with RNNs,2018,"Assessment of apathy in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) relies heavily on interviews with caregivers and patients, which can be ambiguous and time consuming. More precise and objective methods of evaluation can better inform treatment decisions. In this study, visual scanning behaviours (VSBs) on emotional and non-emotional stimuli were used to detect apathy in patients with AD. Forty-eight AD patients participated in the study. Sixteen of the patients were apathetic. Patients looked at 48 slides with non-emotional images and 32 slides with emotional images. We described two methods that use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn differences between the VSBs of apathetic and non-apathetic AD patients. Method 1 uses two separate RNNs to learn group differences between visual scanning sequences on emotional and non-emotional stimuli. The outputs of the RNNs are then combined and used by a logistic regression classifier to characterise patients as either apathetic or non-apathetic. Method 1 achieved an AUC gain of 0.074 compared to a previously presented handcrafted feature method of detecting emotional blunting (AUC handcrafted = 0.646). Method 2 assumes that each individual's ""style of scanning"" (stereotypical eye movements) is independent of the content of the visual stimuli and uses the ""style of scanning"" to normalise the individual's VSBs on emotional and non-emotional stimuli. Method 2 uses RNNs in a sequence-to-sequence configuration to learn the individual's ""style of scanning"". The trained model is then used to create vector representations that contain information on the individual's ""style of scanning"" (content independent) and her/his VSBs (content dependent) on emotional and non-emotional stimuli. The distance between these vector representations is used by a logistic regression classifier to characterise patients as either apathetic or non-apathetic. Using Method 2 the AUC of the classifier improved to 0.814. The results presented suggest that using RNNs to analyse differences between VSBs on emotional and non-emotional stimuli (a measure of emotional blunting) can improve objective detection of apathy in individual patients with AD.",KDD
GCN-MF: Disease-Gene Association Identification By Graph Convolutional Networks and Matrix Factorization,2019,"Discovering disease-gene association is a fundamental and critical biomedical task, which assists biologists and physicians to discover pathogenic mechanism of syndromes. With various clinical biomarkers measuring the similarities among genes and disease phenotypes, network-based semi-supervised learning (NSSL) has been commonly utilized by these studies to address this class-imbalanced large-scale data issue. However, most existing NSSL approaches are based on linear models and suffer from two major limitations: 1) They implicitly consider a local-structure representation for each candidate; 2) They are unable to capture nonlinear associations between diseases and genes. In this paper, we propose a new framework for disease-gene association task by combining Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and matrix factorization, named GCN-MF. With the help of GCN, we could capture non-linear interactions and exploit measured similarities. Moreover, we define a margin control loss function to reduce the effect of sparsity. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed deep learning algorithm outperforms all other state-of-the-art methods on most of metrics.",KDD
Ambulatory Energy Expenditure Estimation: A Machine Learning Approach,2010,"This paper presents a machine learning approach for accurate estimation of energy expenditure using a fusion of accelerometer and heart rate sensing.

This system is meant to enable people to accurately monitor their energy expenditure and intake and make educated tradeoffs to reach their weight goals. In this paper we describe the sensing components of Jog Falls and focus on the energy expenditure estimation algorithm. We present results from controlled experiments in the lab, as well results from a 15 participant user study over a period of 63 days. We show how our algorithm mitigates many of the issues in existing solutions and yields more accurate results.",AAAI
Constraint-Based Verification of a Mobile App Game Designed for Nudging People to Attend Cancer Screening,2017,"In Norway, cervical cancer prevention involves the participation of as many eligible women aged 25-69 years as possible. However, reaching and inviting every eligible women to attend cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination is difficult. Using social nudging and gamification in modern means of communication can encourage the participation of unscreened people. Simula Research Laboratory together with the Cancer Registry of Norway have developed FightHPV, a mobile app game intended to inform adolescent and eligible women about cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination while they play and, to facilitate their further participation to prevention campaigns. However, game design and health information transfer can be hard to reconcile, as the design of each game episode is more guided by the release of information than gameplay and playing difficulty. In this paper, we propose a constraint-based model of FightHPV to evaluate the difficulty of each episode and to help the game designer in improving the player experience. This approach is relevant to facilitate social nudging of eligible women to participate to cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination, as shown by the initial deployment of FightHPV and tests performed in focus groups. The design of this mobile app can thus be regarded as a new application case of Artificial Intelligence techniques such as gamification and constraint programming.",AAAI
Predictive Modeling for Public Health: Preventing Childhood Lead Poisoning,2015,"Lead poisoning is a major public health problem that affects hundreds of thousands of children in the United States every year. A common approach to identifying lead hazards is to test all children for elevated blood lead levels and then investigate and remediate the homes of children with elevated tests. This can prevent exposure to lead of future residents, but only after a child has been poisoned. This paper describes joint work with the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) in which we build a model that predicts the risk of a child to being poisoned so that an intervention can take place before that happens. Using two decades of blood lead level tests, home lead inspections, property value assessments, and census data, our model allows inspectors to prioritize houses on an intractably long list of potential hazards and identify children who are at the highest risk. This work has been described by CDPH as pioneering in the use of machine learning and predictive analytics in public health and has the potential to have a significant impact on both health and economic outcomes for communities across the US.",KDD
Context-Aware Symptom Checking for Disease Diagnosis Using Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning,2018,"Online symptom checkers have been deployed by sites such as WebMD and Mayo Clinic to identify possible causes and treatments for diseases based on a patientÃ¢â¬â¢s symptoms. Symptom checking first assesses a patient by asking a series of questions about their symptoms, then attempts to predict potential diseases. The two design goals of a symptom checker are to achieve high accuracy and intuitive interactions. In this paper we present our context-aware hierarchical reinforcement learning scheme, which significantly improves accuracy of symptom checking over traditional systems while also making a limited number of inquiries.",AAAI
Bidirectional Inference Networks:A Class of Deep Bayesian Networks for Health Profiling,2019,"We consider the problem of inferring the values of an arbitrary set of variables (e.g., risk of diseases) given other observed variables (e.g., symptoms and diagnosed diseases) and high-dimensional signals (e.g., MRI images or EEG). This is a common problem in healthcare since variables of interest often differ for different patients. Existing methods including Bayesian networks and structured prediction either do not incorporate high-dimensional signals or fail to model conditional dependencies among variables. To address these issues, we propose bidirectional inference networks (BIN), which stich together multiple probabilistic neural networks, each modeling a conditional dependency. Predictions are then made via iteratively updating variables using backpropagation (BP) to maximize corresponding posterior probability. Furthermore, we extend BIN to composite BIN (CBIN), which involves the iterative prediction process in the training stage and improves both accuracy and computational efficiency by adaptively smoothing the optimization landscape. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets (a sleep study and a dermatology dataset) show that CBIN is a single model that can achieve state-of-the-art performance and obtain better accuracy in most inference tasks than multiple models each specifically trained for a different task.",AAAI
Phase-Mapper: An AI Platform to Accelerate High Throughput Materials Discovery,2017,"High-throughput materials discovery involves the rapid synthesis, measurement, and characterization of many different but structurally related materials. A central problem in materials discovery, the phase map identification problem, involves the determination of the crystal structure of materials from materials composition and structural characterization data. We present Phase-Mapper, a novel solution platform that allows humans to interact with both the data and products of AI algorithms, including the incorporation of human feedback to constrain or initialize solutions. Phase-Mapper is compatible with any spectral demixing algorithm, including our novel solver, AgileFD, which is based on convolutive non-negative matrix factorization. AgileFD allows materials scientists to rapidly interpret XRD patterns, and can incorporate constraints to capture the physics of the materials as well as human feedback. We compare three solver variants with previously proposed methods in a large-scale experiment involving 20 synthetic systems, demonstrating the efficacy of imposing physical constraints using AgileFD. Since the deployment of Phase-Mapper at the Department of Energy's Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis (JCAP), thousands of X-ray diffraction patterns have been processed and the results are yielding discovery of new materials for energy applications, as exemplified by the discovery of a new family of metal oxide solar light absorbers, among the previously unsolved Nb-Mn-V oxide system, which is provided here as an illustrative example. Phase-Mapper is also being deployed at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) to enable phase mapping on datasets in real time.",AAAI
Blue Skies: A Methodology for Data-Driven Clear Sky Modelling,2017,"One of the major challenges confronting the widespread adoption of solar energy is the uncertainty of production. The energy generated by photo-voltaic systems is a function of the received solar irradiance which varies due to atmospheric and weather conditions. A key component required for forecasting irradiance accurately is the clear sky model which estimates the average irradiance at a location at a given time in the absence of clouds. Current methods for modelling clear sky irradiance are either inaccurate or require extensive atmospheric data, which tends to vary with location and is often unavailable. In this paper, we present a data-driven methodology, Blue Skies, for modelling clear sky irradiance solely based on historical irradiance measurements. Using machine learning techniques, Blue Skies is able to generate clear sky models that are more accurate spatio-temporally compared to the state of the art, reducing errors by almost 50%.",IJCAI
Multi-Instance Multi-Label Class Discovery: A Computational Approach for Assessing Bird Biodiversity,2016,"We study the problem of analyzing a large volume ofbioacoustic data collected in-situ with the goal of assessingthe biodiversity of bird species at the data collectionsite.

Deep Multi-species Embedding,2017,"Understanding how species are distributed across landscapes over time is a fundamental question in biodiversity research. Unfortunately, most species distribution models only target a single species at a time, despite strong ecological evidence that species are not independently distributed. We propose Deep Multi-Species Embedding (DMSE), which jointly embeds vectors corresponding to multiple species as well as vectors representing environmental covariates into a common high-dimensional feature space via a deep neural network. Applied to bird observational data from the citizen science project eBird, we demonstrate how the DMSE model discovers inter-species relationships to outperform single-species distribution models (random forests and SVMs) as well as competing multi-label models. Additionally, we demonstrate the benefit of using a deep neural network to extract features within the embedding and show how they improve the predictive performance of species distribution modelling. An important domain contribution of the DMSE model is the ability to discover and describe species interactions while simultaneously learning the shared habitat preferences among species. As an additional contribution, we provide a graphical embedding of hundreds of bird species in the Northeast US.",IJCAI
Bias Reduction via End-to-End Shift Learning: Application to Citizen Science,2019,"Citizen science projects are successful at gathering rich datasets for various applications. However, the data collected by citizen scientists are often biased Ã¢â¬â in particular, aligned more with the citizensÃ¢â¬â¢ preferences than with scientific objectives. We propose the Shift Compensation Network (SCN), an end-to-end learning scheme which learns the shift from the scientific objectives to the biased data while compensating for the shift by re-weighting the training data. Applied to bird observational data from the citizen science project eBird, we demonstrate how SCN quantifies the data distribution shift and outperforms supervised learning models that do not address the data bias. Compared with competing models in the context of covariate shift, we further demonstrate the advantage of SCN in both its effectiveness and its capability of handling massive high-dimensional data.",AAAI
Clustering Species Accumulation Curves to Identify Skill Levels of Citizen Scientists Participating in the eBird Project,2014,"Although citizen science projects such as eBird can compile large volumes of data over broad spatial and temporal extents, the quality of this data is a concern due to differences in the skills of volunteers at identifying bird species. Species accumulation curves, which plot the number of unique species observed over time, are an effective way to quantify the skill level of an eBird participant. Intuitively, more skilled observers can identify a greater number of species per unit time than inexperienced birders, resulting in a steeper curve. We propose a mixture model for clustering species accumulation curves. These clusters enable the identification of distinct skill levels of eBird participants, which can then be used to build more accurate species distribution models and to develop automated data quality filters.",AAAI
Incorporating Boosted Regression Trees into Ecological Latent Variable Models,2011,"Important ecological phenomena are often observed indirectly. Consequently, probabilistic latent variable models provide an important tool, because they can include explicit models of the ecological phenomenon of interest and the process by which it is observed. However, existing latent variable methods rely on hand-formulated parametric models, which are expensive to design and require extensive preprocessing of the data. Nonparametric methods (such as regression trees) automate these decisions and produce highly accurate models. However, existing tree methods learn direct mappings from inputs to outputs Ã¢â¬â they cannot be applied to latent variable models. This paper describes a methodology for integrating nonparametric tree methods into probabilistic latent variable models by extending functional gradient boosting. The approach is presented in the context of occupancy-detection (OD) modeling, where the goal is to model the distribution of a species from imperfect detections. Experiments on 12 real and 3 synthetic bird species compare standard and tree-boosted OD models (latent variable models) with standard and tree-boosted logistic regression models (without latent structure). All methods perform similarly when predicting the observed variables, but the OD models learn better representations of the latent process. Most importantly, tree-boosted OD models learn the best latent representations when nonlinearities and interactions are present.",AAAI
A Latent Variable Model for Discovering Bird Species Commonly Misidentified by Citizen Scientists,2014,"Data quality is a common source of concern for large-scale citizen science projects like eBird. In the case of eBird, a major cause of poor quality data is the misidentification of bird species by inexperienced contributors. A proactive approach for improving data quality is to discover commonly misidentified bird species and to teach inexperienced birders the differences between these species. To accomplish this goal, we develop a latent variable graphical model that can identify groups of bird species that are often confused for each other by eBird participants. Our model is a multi-species extension of the classic occupancy-detection model in the ecology literature. This multi-species extension requires a structure learning step as well as a computationally expensive parameter learning stage which we make efficient through a variational approximation. We show that our model can not only discover groups of misidentified species, but by including these misidentifications in the model, it can also achieve more accurate predictions of both species occupancy and detection.",AAAI
On the quality of inferring interests from social neighbors,2010,"This paper intends to provide some insights of a scientific problem: how likely one's interests can be inferred from his/her social connections -- friends, friends' friends, 3-degree friends, etc? Is ""Birds of a Feather Flocks Together"" a norm? We do not consider the friending activity on online social networking sites. Instead, we conduct this study by implementing a privacy-preserving large distribute social sensor system in a large global IT company to capture the multifaceted activities of 30,000+ people, including communications (e.g., emails, instant messaging, etc) and Web 2.0 activities (e.g., social bookmarking, file sharing, blogging, etc). These activities occupy the majority of employees' time in work, and thus, provide a high quality approximation to the real social connections of employees in the workplace context. In addition to such ""informal networks"", we investigated the ""formal networks"", such as their hierarchical structure, as well as the demographic profile data such as geography, job role, self-specified interests, etc. Because user ID matching across multiple sources on the Internet is very difficult, and most user activity logs have to be anonymized before they are processed, no prior studies could collect comparable multifaceted activity data of individuals. That makes this study unique. In this paper, we present a technique to predict the inference quality by utilizing (1) network analysis and network autocorrelation modeling of informal and formal networks, and (2) regression models to predict user interest inference quality from network characteristics. We verify our findings with experiments on both implicit user interests indicated by the content of communications or Web 2.0 activities, and explicit user interests specified in user profiles. We demonstrate that the inference quality prediction increases the inference quality of implicit interests by 42.8%, and inference quality of explicit interests by up to 101%.",KDD
Approximate Bayesian Inference for Reconstructing Velocities of Migrating Birds from Weather Radar,2013,"Archived data from the WSR-88D network of weather radars in the US hold detailed information about the continent-scale migratory movements of birds over the last 20 years.

Forecasting Multi-Appliance Usage for Smart Home Energy Management,2013,"We address the problem of forecasting the usage of multiple electrical appliances by domestic users, with the aim of providing suggestions about the best time to run appliances in order to reduce carbon emissions and save money (assuming time-of-use pricing), while minimising the impact on the users' daily habits.An important challenge related to this problem is the modelling the everyday routine of the consumers and of the inter-dependencies between the use of different appliances. Given this, we develop an important building block of future home energy management systems: a prediction algorithm, based on a graphical model, that captures the everyday habits and the inter-dependency between appliances by exploiting their periodic features.We demonstrate through extensive empirical evaluations on real-world data from a prominent database that our approach outperforms existing methods by up to 47%.",IJCAI
FireCast: Leveraging Deep Learning to Predict Wildfire Spread,2019,"Destructive wildfires result in billions of dollars in damage each year and are expected to increase in frequency, duration, and severity due to climate change.

We present and evaluate a novel system, FireCast. FireCast combines artificial intelligence (AI) techniques with data collection strategies from geographic information systems (GIS). FireCast predicts which areas surrounding a burning wildfire have high-risk of near-future wildfire spread, based on historical fire data and using modest computational resources.

We derive two novel algorithms for computation that are tailored for dense, gridded observations over both space and time. We evaluate our methods with a simulation that mimics these dataÃ¢â¬â¢s features and on a large, publicly available, global temperature dataset with the eventual goal of tracking trends in cloud reflectance temperature variability.",AAAI
Accurate Integration of Aerosol Predictions by Smoothing on a Manifold,2014,"Accurately measuring the aerosol optical depth (AOD) is essential for our understanding of the climate. Currently, AOD can be measured by (i) satellite instruments, which operate on a global scale but have limited accuracies; and (ii) ground-based instruments, which are more accurate but not widely available. Recent approaches focus on integrating measurements from these two sources to complement each other. In this paper, we further improve the prediction accuracy by using the observation that the AOD varies slowly in the spatial domain. Using a probabilistic approach, we impose this smoothness constraint by a Gaussian random field on the Earth's surface, which can be considered as a two-dimensional manifold. The proposed integration approach is computationally simple, and experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data sets show that it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art.",AAAI
Interpretable Predictive Modeling for Climate Variables with Weighted Lasso,2019,"An important family of problems in climate science focus on finding predictive relationships between various climate variables. In this paper, we consider the problem of predicting monthly deseasonalized land temperature at different locations worldwide based on sea surface temperature (SST). Contrary to popular belief on the trade-off between (a) simple interpretable but inaccurate models and (b) complex accurate but uninterpretable models, we introduce a weighted Lasso model for the problem which yields interpretable results while being highly accurate. Covariate weights in the regularization of weighted Lasso are pre-determined, and proportional to the spatial distance of the covariate (sea surface location) from the target (land location). We establish finite sample estimation error bounds for weighted Lasso, and illustrate its superior empirical performance and interpretability over complex models such as deep neural networks (Deep nets) and gradient boosted trees (GBT). We also present a detailed empirical analysis of what went wrong with Deep nets here, which may serve as a helpful guideline for application of Deep nets to small sample scientific problems.",AAAI
Learning Large-Scale Dynamic Discrete Choice Models of Spatio-Temporal Preferences with Application to Migratory Pastoralism in East Africa,2015,"Understanding spatio-temporal resource preferences is paramount in the design of policies for sustainable development. Unfortunately, resource preferences are often unknown to policy-makers and have to be inferred from data. In this paper we consider the problem of inferring agents' preferences from observed movement trajectories, and formulate it as an Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) problem . With the goal of informing policy-making, we take a probabilistic approach and consider generative models that can be used to simulate behavior under new circumstances such as changes in resource availability, access policies, or climate. We study the Dynamic Discrete Choice (DDC) models from econometrics and prove that they generalize the Max-Entropy IRL model, a widely used probabilistic approach from the machine learning literature. Furthermore, we develop SPL-GD, a new learning algorithm for DDC models that is considerably faster than the state of the art and scales to very large datasets. We consider an application in the context of pastoralism in the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, where migratory pastoralists face regular risks due to resource availability, droughts, and resource degradation from climate change and development. We show how our approach based on satellite and survey data can accurately model migratory pastoralism in East Africa and that it considerably outperforms other approaches on a large-scale real-world dataset of pastoralists' movements in Ethiopia collected over 3 years.",AAAI
Understanding Dominant Factors for Precipitation over the Great Lakes Region,2016,"Statistical modeling of local precipitation involves understanding local, regional and global factors informative of precipitation variability in a region. Modern machine learning methods for feature selection can potentially be explored for identifying statistically significant features from pool of potential predictors of precipitation. In this work, we consider sparse regression, which simultaneously performs feature selection and regression, followed by random permutation tests for selecting dominant factors. We consider average winter precipitation over Great Lakes Region in order to identify its dominant influencing factors.Experiments show that global climate indices, computed at different temporal lags, offer predictive information for winter precipitation. Further, among the dominant factors identified using randomized permutation tests, multiple climate indices indicate the influence of geopotential height patterns on winter precipitation.Using composite analysis, we illustrate that certain patterns are indeed typical in high and low precipitation years, and offer plausible scientific reasons for variations in precipitation.Thus, feature selection methods can be useful in identifying influential climate processes and variables, and thereby provide useful hypotheses over physical mechanisms affecting local precipitation.",AAAI
Nonparametric Mixture of Sparse Regressions on Spatio-Temporal Data -- An Application to Climate Prediction,2019,"Climate prediction is a very challenging problem. Many institutes around the world try to predict climate variables by building climate models called General Circulation Models (GCMs), which are based on mathematical equations that describe the physical processes. The prediction abilities of different GCMs may vary dramatically across different regions and time. Motivated by the need of identifying which GCMs are more useful for a particular region and time, we introduce a clustering model combining Dirichlet Process (DP) mixture of sparse linear regression with Markov Random Fields (MRFs). This model incorporates DP to automatically determine the number of clusters, imposes MRF constraints to guarantee spatio-temporal smoothness, and selects a subset of GCMs that are useful for prediction within each spatio-temporal cluster with a spike-and-slab prior. We derive an effective Gibbs sampling method for this model. Experimental results are provided for both synthetic and real-world climate data.",KDD
Testing the significance of spatio-temporal teleconnection patterns,2012,"Dipoles represent long distance connections between the pressure anomalies of two distant regions that are negatively correlated with each other. Such dipoles have proven important for understanding and explaining the variability in climate in many regions of the world, e.g., the El Nino climate phenomenon is known to be responsible for precipitation and temperature anomalies over large parts of the world. Systematic approaches for dipole detection generate a large number of candidate dipoles, but there exists no method to evaluate the significance of the candidate teleconnections. In this paper, we present a novel method for testing the statistical significance of the class of spatio-temporal teleconnection patterns called as dipoles. One of the most important challenges in addressing significance testing in a spatio-temporal context is how to address the spatial and temporal dependencies that show up as high autocorrelation. We present a novel approach that uses the wild bootstrap to capture the spatio-temporal dependencies, in the special use case of teleconnections in climate data. Our approach to find the statistical significance takes into account the autocorrelation, the seasonality and the trend in the time series over a period of time. This framework is applicable to other problems in spatio-temporal data mining to assess the significance of the patterns.",KDD
Extracting Urban Microclimates from Electricity Bills,2017,"Sustainable energy policies are of growing importance in all urban centers.Climate â and climate change â will play increasingly important roles in these policies.Climate zones defined by the California Energy Commissionhave long been influential in energy management.For example, recently a two-zone division of Los Angeles(defined by historical temperature averages) was introduced for electricity rate restructuring.The importance of climate zones has been enormous,and climate change could make them still more important. AI can provide improvements on the ways climate zones are derived and managed.This paper reports on analysis of aggregate household electricity consumption (EC) data from local utilities in Los Angeles,seeking possible improvements in energy management. In this analysis we noticed that EC data permits identificationof interesting geographical zones â regions having EC patterns that are characteristically different from surrounding regions.We believe these zones could be useful in a variety of urban models.",AAAI
Spatial-temporal causal modeling for climate change attribution,2009,"Attribution of climate change to causal factors has been based predominantly on simulations using physical climate models, which have inherent limitations in describing such a complex and chaotic system. We propose an alternative, data centric, approach that relies on actual measurements of climate observations and human and natural forcing factors. Specifically, we develop a novel method to infer causality from spatial-temporal data, as well as a procedure to incorporate extreme value modeling into our method in order to address the attribution of extreme climate events, such as heatwaves. Our experimental results on a real world dataset indicate that changes in temperature are not solely accounted for by solar radiance, but attributed more significantly to CO2 and other greenhouse gases. Combined with extreme value modeling, we also show that there has been a significant increase in the intensity of extreme temperatures, and that such changes in extreme temperature are also attributable to greenhouse gases. These preliminary results suggest that our approach can offer a useful alternative to the simulation-based approach to climate modeling and attribution, and provide valuable insights from a fresh perspective.",KDD
Spatial Projection of Multiple Climate Variables Using Hierarchical Multitask Learning,2017,"Future projection of climate is typically obtained by combining outputs from multiple Earth System Models (ESMs) for several climate variables such as temperature and precipitation. While IPCC has traditionally used a simple model output average, recent work has illustrated potential advantages of using a multitask learning (MTL) framework for projections of individual climate variables. In this paper we introduce a framework for hierarchical multitask learning (HMTL) with two levels of tasks such that each super-task, i.e., task at the top level, is itself a multitask learning problem over sub-tasks. For climate projections, each super-task focuses on projections of specific climate variables spatially using an MTL formulation. For the proposed HMTL approach, a group lasso regularization is added to couple parameters across the super-tasks, which in the climate context helps exploit relationships among the behavior of different climate variables at a given spatial location. We show that some recent works on MTL based on learning task dependency structures can be viewed as special cases of HMTL. Experiments on synthetic and real climate data show that HMTL produces better results than decoupled MTL methods applied separately on the super-tasks and HMTL significantly outperforms baselines for climate projection.",AAAI
Multiple Hypothesis Object Tracking For Unsupervised Self-Learning: An Ocean Eddy Tracking Application,2013,"Mesoscale ocean eddies transport heat, salt, energy, and nutrients across oceans. As a result, accurately identifying and tracking such phenomena are crucial for understanding ocean dynamics and marine ecosystem sustainability. Traditionally, ocean eddies are monitored through two phases: identification and tracking. A major challenge for such an approach is that the tracking phase is dependent on the performance of the identification scheme, which can be susceptible to noise and sampling errors. In this paper, we focus on tracking, and introduce the concept of multiple hypothesis assignment (MHA), which extends traditional multiple hypothesis tracking for cases where the features tracked are noisy or uncertain. Under this scheme, features are assigned to multiple potential tracks, and the final assignment is deferred until more data are available to make a relatively unambiguous decision. Unlike the most widely used methods in the eddy tracking literature, MHA uses contextual spatio-temporal information to take corrective measures autonomously on the detection step a pos- teriori and performs significantly better in the presence of noise. This study is also the first to empirically analyze the relative robustness of eddy tracking algorithms.",AAAI
Discrete Interventions in Hawkes Processes with Applications in Invasive Species Management,2018,"The spread of invasive species to new areas threatens the stability of ecosystems and causes major economic losses. We propose a novel approach to minimize the spread of an invasive species given a limited intervention budget. We first model invasive species spread using Hawkes processes, and then derive closed-form expressions for characterizing the effect of an intervention action on the invasion process. We use this to obtain an optimal intervention plan based on an integer programming formulation, and compare the optimal plan against several ecologically-motivated heuristic strategies used in practice. We present an empirical study of two variants of the invasive control problem: minimizing the final rate of invasions, and minimizing the number of invasions at the end of a given time horizon. The optimized intervention achieves nearly the same level of control that would be attained by completely eradicating the species, but at only 60-80\% of the cost.",IJCAI
Resource Sharing for Control of Wildland Fires,2013,"Wildland fires (or wildfires) occur on all continents except for Antarctica. These fires threaten communities, change ecosystems, destroy vast quantities of natural resources and the cost estimates of the damage done annually is in the billions of dollars. Controlling wildland fires is resource-intensive and there are numerous examples where the resource demand has outstripped resource availability. Trends in changing climates, fire occurrence and the expansion of the wildland-urban interface all point to increased resource shortages in the future.One approach for coping with these shortages has been the sharing of resources across different wildland-fire agencies. This introduces new issues as agencies have to balance their own needs and risk-management with their desire to help fellow agencies in need. Using ideas from the field of multiagent systems, we conduct the first analysis of strategic issues arising in resource-sharing for wildland-fire control. We also argue that the wildland-fire domain has numerous features that make it attractive to researchers in artificial intelligence and computational sustainability.",AAAI
Efficient Coordinated Power Distribution on Private Infrastructure (Page 805),2014,"Electric Vehicles (EVs) and their integration in the smart grid are challenges that sustainable societies have to tackle. Large scale uncoordinated EV charging increases peak demand and creates the need for extra grid infrastructure to be covered effectively, which is a costly solution. We propose a decentralized charging strategy for EV customers that offers savings for the individual adopters on their electricity bill and at the same time peak demand reduction, alleviating smart grid from critical strains. We implement our charging strategy through learning agents that act on behalf of EV owners and examine the effect of our strategy under the prism of various market conditions.",AAMAS
Model-Free Iterative Temporal Appliance Discovery for Unsupervised Electricity Disaggregation,2018,"Electricity disaggregation identifies individual appliances from one or more aggregate data streams and has immense potential to reduce residential and commercial electrical waste. Since supervised learning methods rely on meticulously labeled training samples that are expensive to obtain, unsupervised methods show the most promise for wide-spread application. However, unsupervised learning methods previously applied to electricity disaggregation suffer from critical limitations. This paper introduces the concept of iterative appliance discovery, a novel unsupervised disaggregation method that progressively identifies the ""easiest to find"" or ""most likely"" appliances first. Once these simpler appliances have been identified, the computational complexity of the search space can be significantly reduced, enabling iterative discovery to identify more complex appliances. We test iterative appliance discovery against an existing competitive unsupervised method using two publicly available datasets. Results using different sampling rates show iterative discovery has faster runtimes and produces better accuracy. Furthermore, iterative discovery does not require prior knowledge of appliance characteristics and demonstrates unprecedented scalability to identify long, overlapped sequences that other unsupervised learning algorithms cannot.",AAAI
Energy Disaggregation via Learning Powerlets and Sparse Coding,2015,"In this paper, we consider the problem of energy disaggregation, i.e., decomposing a whole home electricity signal into its component appliances. We propose a new supervised algorithm, which in the learning stage, automatically extracts signature consumption patterns of each device by modeling the device as a mixture of dynamical systems. In order to extract signature consumption patterns of a device corresponding to its different modes of operation, we define appropriate dissimilarities between energy snippets of the device and use them in a subset selection scheme, which we generalize to deal with time-series data. We then form a dictionary that consists of extracted power signatures across all devices. We cast the disaggregation problem as an optimization over a representation in the learned dictionary and incorporate several novel priors such as device-sparsity, knowledge about devices that do or do not work together as well as temporal consistency of the disaggregated solution. Real experiments on a publicly available energy dataset demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves promising results for energy disaggregation.",AAAI
Energy Usage Behavior Modeling in Energy Disaggregation via Marked Hawkes Process,2015,"Energy disaggregation, the task of taking a whole home electricity signal and decomposing it into its component appliances, has been proved to be essential in energy conservation research. One powerful cue for breaking down the entire household's energy consumption is user's daily energy usage behavior, which has so far received little attention: existing works on energy disaggregation mostly ignored the relationship between the energy usages of various appliances across different time slots. To model such relationship, we combine topic models with Hawkes processes, and propose a novel probabilistic model based on marked Hawkes process that enables the modeling of marked event data. The proposed model seeks to capture the influence from the occurrence and the marks of one usage event to the occurrence and the marks of subsequent usage events in the future. We also develop an inference algorithm based on variational inference for model parameter estimation. Experimental results on both synthetic data and three real world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in decomposing the entire consumed energy to each appliance. Analyzing the influence captured by the proposed model provides further insights into numerous interesting energy usage behavior patterns.",AAAI
Negotiated Learning for Smart Grid Agents: Entity Selection based on Dynamic Partially Observable Features,2013,"An attractive approach to managing electricity demand in the Smart Grid relies on real-time pricing (RTP) tariffs, where customers are incentivized to quickly adapt to changes in the cost of supply. However, choosing amongst competitive RTP tariffs is difficult when tariff prices change rapidly. The problem is further complicated when we assume that the price changes for a tariff are published in real-time only to those customers who are currently subscribed to that tariff, thus making the prices partially observable. We present models and learning algorithms for autonomous agents that can address the tariff selection problem on behalf of customers. We introduce 'Negotiated Learning', a general algorithm that enables a self-interested sequential decision-making agent to periodically select amongst a variable set of 'entities' (e.g., tariffs) by negotiating with other agents in the environment to gather information about dynamic partially observable entity 'features' (e.g., tariff prices) that affect the entity selection decision. We also contribute a formulation of the tariff selection problem as a 'Negotiable Entity Selection Process', a novel representation. We support our contributions with intuitive justification and simulation experiments based on real data on an open Smart Grid simulation platform.Ã",AAAI
Cooperative Virtual Power Plant Formation Using Scoring Rules,2012,"Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) are fast emerging as a suitable means of integrating small and distributed energy resources (DERs), like wind and solar, into the electricity supply network (Grid). VPPs are formed via the aggregation of a large number of such DERs, so that they exhibit the characteristics of a traditional generator in terms of predictability and robustness. In this work, we promote the formation of such ""cooperative'' VPPs (CVPPs) using multi-agent technology. In particular, we design a payment mechanism that encourages DERs to join CVPPs with large overall production. Our method is based on strictly proper scoring rules and incentivises the provision of accurate predictions from the CVPPs---and in turn, the member DERs---which aids in the planning of the supply schedule at the Grid. We empirically evaluate our approach using the real-world setting of 16 commercial wind farms in the UK. We show that our mechanism incentivises real DERs to form CVPPs, and outperforms the current state of the art payment mechanism developed for this problem.",AAAI
2D-interval predictions for time series,2011,"Research on time series forecasting is mostly focused on point predictions - models are obtained to estimate the expected value of the target variable for a certain point in future. However, for several relevant applications this type of forecasts has limited utility (e.g. costumer wallet value estimation, wind and electricity power production, control of water quality, etc.). For these domains it is frequently more important to be able to forecast a range of plausible future values of the target variable. A typical example is wind power production, where it is of high relevance to predict the future wind variability in order to ensure that supply and demand are balanced. This type of predictions will allow timely actions to be taken in order to cope with the expected values of the target variable on a certain future time horizon. In this paper we study this type of predictions - the prediction of a range of expected values for a future time interval. We describe some possible approaches to this task and propose an alternative procedure that our extensive experiments on both artificial and real world domains show to have clear advantages.",KDD
Prediction-of-Use Games: A Cooperative Game Theory Approach to Sustainable Energy Tariffs (Page 829),2014,"Current electricity tariffs do not reflect the real costs that a customer incurs to a supplier, as units are charged at the same rate, regardless of the consumption pattern. In this paper, we propose a prediction-of-use tariff that better reflects these costs, which asks customers to predict a baseline consumption, and charges them based both on their actual consumption, and the deviation from their prediction. We show how under this tariff no customer would have an incentive to consume in excess of their actual needs, and derive closed form expressions for their optimal prediction and expected payments. Second, using principles from cooperative game theory, we study how customers can collectively reduce their potential deviation by aggregating under a group-buying scheme. We prove that the associated cost game is concave, which means grouping reduces the total expected bill and that this payment can be fairly allocated among customers by their Shapley values. Third, considering a model where customers can join the group online, we propose marginal payment allocation schemes that incentivise them to commit early, thus preventing start-up inertia. Finally, we validate our model using real data from a set of 3000 consumers from the UK.",AAMAS
AgentSwitch: Towards Smart Energy Tariff Selection (Page 981),2013,"In this paper, we present AgentSwitch, a prototype agent-basedplatform to solve the electricity tariff selection problem. Agent-Switch incorporates novel algorithms to make predictions of hourlyenergy usage as well as detect (and suggest to the user) deferrableloads that could be shifted to off-peak times to maximise savings.To take advantage of group discounts from energy retailers, wedevelop a new scalable collective energy purchasing mechanism,based on the Shapley value, that ensures individual members of acollective (interacting through AgentSwitch) fairly share the dis-counts. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms we em-pirically evaluate them individually on real-world data (with up to3000 homes in the UK) and show that they outperform the stateof the art in their domains. Finally, to ensure individual compo-nents are accountable in providing recommendations, we providea novel provenance-tracking service to record the flow of data inthe system, and therefore provide users with a means of checkingthe provenance of suggestions from AgentSwitch and assess theirreliability.",AAMAS
Decentralized Coordination Of Plug-in Hybrid Vehicles For Imbalance Reduction In A Smart Grid,2011,"Intelligent electricity grids, or 'Smart Grids', are being introduced at a rapid pace. Smart grids allow the management of new distributed power generators such as solar panels and wind turbines, and innovative power consumers such as plug-in hybrid vehicles. One challenge in Smart Grids is to fulfill consumer demands while avoiding infrastructure overloads. Another challenge is to reduce imbalance costs: after ahead scheduling of production and consumption (the socalled 'load schedule'), unpredictable changes in production and consumption yield a cost for repairing this balance. To cope with these risks and costs, we propose a decentralized, multi-agent system solution for coordinated charging of PHEVs in a Smart Grid. Essentially, the MAS utilizes an ""intention graph"" for expressing the flexibility of a fleet of PHEVs. Based on this flexibility, charging of PHEVs can be rescheduled in real-time to reduce imbalances. We discuss and evaluate two scheduling strategies for reducing imbalance costs: reactive scheduling and proactive scheduling. Simulations show that reactive scheduling is able to reduce imbalance costs by 14%, while proactive scheduling yields the highest imbalance cost reduction of 44%.",AAMAS
Randomized Load Control: A Simple Distributed Approach for Scheduling Smart Appliances,2013,"A significant portion of the electricity network capacity is built to run only a few days a year when demand peaks. As a result, expensive power generation plants and equipment costing millions of dollars are sitting idle most of the time, which increases costs for everyone. We present randomized load control, a simple distributed approach for scheduling smart appliances. Randomized load control schedules the start time of appliances that are programmed to run within a specified time window, so that the aggregate load achieves a given ideal load. Our results show that we do achieve the given ideal load to a great extent. This is remarkable as the approach is completely distributed and preserves customer privacy as the scheduling happens within each house or building separately.",IJCAI
Autonomous Electricity Trading Using Time-of-Use Tariffs in a Competitive Market,2016,"This paper studies the impact of Time-Of-Use (TOU) tariffs in a competitive electricity market place. Specifically, it focuses on the question of how should an autonomous broker agent optimize TOU tariffs in a competitive retail market, and what is the impact of such tariffs on the economy. We formalize the problem of TOU tariff optimization and propose an algorithm for approximating its solution. We extensively experiment with our algorithm in a large-scale, detailed electricity retail markets simulation of the Power Trading Agent Competition (Power TAC) and: 1) find that our algorithm results in 15% peak-demand reduction, 2) find that its peak-flattening results in greater profit and/or profit-share for the broker and allows it to win against the 1st and 2nd place brokers from the Power TAC 2014 finals, and 3) analyze several economic implications of using TOU tariffs in competitive retail markets.",AAAI
An Axiomatic Framework for Ex-Ante Dynamic Pricing Mechanisms in Smart Grid,2016,"In electricity markets, the choice of the right pricing regime is crucial for the utilities because the price they charge to their consumers, in anticipation of their demand in real-time, is a key determinant of their profits and ultimately their survival in competitive energy markets. Among the existing pricing regimes, in this paper, we consider ex-ante dynamic pricing schemes as (i) they help to address the peak demand problem (a crucial problem in smart grids), and (ii) they are transparent and fair to consumers as the cost of electricity can be calculated before the actual consumption. In particular, we propose an axiomatic framework that establishes the conceptual underpinnings of the class of ex-ante dynamic pricing schemes. We first propose five key axioms that reflect the criteria that are vital for energy utilities and their relationship with consumers. We then prove an impossibility theorem to show that there is no pricing regime that satisfies all the five axioms simultaneously. We also study multiple cost functions arising from various pricing regimes to examine the subset of axioms that they satisfy. We believe that our proposed framework in this paper is first of its kind to evaluate the class of ex-ante dynamic pricing schemes in a manner that can be operationalised by energy utilities.",AAAI
Efficient Buyer Groups for Prediction-of-Use Electricity Tariffs,2014,"Current electricity tariffs do not reflect the real cost that customers incur to suppliers, as units are charged at the same rate, regardless of how predictable each customer's consumption is. A recent proposal to address this problem are prediction-of-use tariffs. In such tariffs, a customer is asked in advance to predict her future consumption, and is charged based both on her actual consumption and the deviation from her prediction. Prior work {aamas2014} studied the cost game induced by a single such tariff, and showed customers would have an incentive to minimize their risk, by joining together when buying electricity as a grand coalition. In this work we study the efficient (i.e. cost-minimizing) structure of buying groups for the more realistic setting when multiple, competing prediction-of-use tariffs are available. We propose a polynomial time algorithm to compute efficient buyer groups, and validate our approach experimentally, using a large-scale data set of domestic electricity consumers in the UK.",AAAI
Agent Cooperatives for Effective Power Consumption Shifting,2013,"In this paper, we present a directly applicable scheme for electricity consumption shifting and effective demand curve flattening. The scheme can employ the services of either individual or cooperating consumer agents alike. Agents participating in the scheme, however, are motivated to form cooperatives, in order to reduce their electricity bills via lower group prices granted for sizable consumption shifting from high to low demand time intervals. The scheme takes into account individual costs, and uses a strictly proper scoring rule to reward contributors according to efficiency. Cooperative members, in particular, can attain variable reduced electricity price rates, given their different load shifting capabilities. This allows even agents with initially forbidding shifting costs to participate in the scheme, and is achieved by a weakly budget-balanced, truthful reward sharing mechanism. We provide four variants of this approach, and evaluate it experimentally.",AAAI
Algorithms for Fair Load Shedding in Developing Countries,2018,"Due to the limited generation capacity of power stations, many developing countries frequently resort to disconnecting large parts of the power grid from supply, a process termed load shedding. During load shedding, many homes are left without electricity, causing them inconvenience and discomfort. In this paper, we present a number of optimization heuristics that focus on pairwise and groupwise fairness, such that households (i.e. agents) are fairly allocated electricity. We evaluate the heuristics against standard fairness metrics in terms of comfort delivered to homes, as well as the number of times they are disconnected from electricity supply. Thus, we establish new benchmarks for fair load shedding schemes.",IJCAI
Optimizing Energy Costs in a Zinc and Lead Mine,2016,"Boliden Tara Mines Ltd. consumed 184.7 GWh of electricity in 2014, equating to over 1% of the national demand of Ireland or approximately 35,000 homes. IrelandÃ¢â¬â¢s industrial electricity prices, at an average of 13 c/KWh in 2014, are amongst the most expensive in Europe. Cost effective electricity procurement is ever more pressing for businesses to remain competitive. In parallel, the proliferation of intelligent devices has led to the industrial Internet of Things paradigm becoming mainstream. As more and more devices become equipped with network connectivity, smart metering is fast becoming a means of giving energy users access to a rich array of consumption data. These modern sensor networks have facilitated the development of applications to process, analyse, and react to continuous data streams in real-time. Subsequently, future procurement and consumption decisions can be informed by a highly detailed evaluation of energy usage. With these considerations in mind, this paper uses variable energy prices from IrelandÃ¢â¬â¢s Single Electricity Market, along with smart meter sensor data, to simulate the scheduling of an industrial-sized underground pump station in Tara Mines. The objective is to reduce the overall energy costs whilst still functioning within the systemÃ¢â¬â¢s operational constraints.

Regularization in Hierarchical Time Series Forecasting with Application to Electricity Smart Meter Data,2017,"Accurate electricity demand forecast plays a key role in sustainable power systems. It enables better decision making in the planning of electricity generation and distribution for many use cases. The electricity demand data can often be represented in a hierarchical structure. For example, the electricity consumption of a whole country could be disaggregated by states, cities, and households. Hierarchical forecasts require not only good prediction accuracy at each level of the hierarchy, but also the consistency between different levels. State-of-the-art hierarchical forecasting methods usually apply adjustments on the individual level forecasts to satisfy the aggregation constraints. However, the high-dimensionality of the unpenalized regression problem and the estimation errors in the high-dimensional error covariance matrix can lead to increased variability in the revised forecasts with poor prediction performance. In order to provide more robustness to estimation errors in the adjustments, we present a new hierarchical forecasting algorithm that computes sparse adjustments while still preserving the aggregation constraints. We formulate the problem as a high-dimensional penalized regression, which can be efficiently solved using cyclical coordinate descent methods. We also conduct experiments using a large-scale hierarchical electricity demand data. The results confirm the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art hierarchical forecasting methods, in both the sparsity of the adjustments and the prediction accuracy. The proposed approach to hierarchical forecasting could be useful for energy generation including solar and wind energy, as well as numerous other applications.",AAAI
Fancy That: Measuring Electricity Grid Voltage Using a Phone and a Fan,2018,"We describe the design, development, and characterization of a system that uses only a commodity smartphone and a consumer fan to measure the voltage of an electricity grid. This system represents the first known example of a system for measuring power quality of an electricity grid without specialized equipment, and can enable those with electricity access who live in ""weak grid"" environments to determine the current state of their electricity system, especially whether it is safe to plug in appliances. Our work leverages the microphone of the phone to measure the disturbance created on a pure sinusoidal tone into a running fan. The distance between adjacent harmonics in this disturbance is a direct proxy for the electricity grid voltage. We build a system to exploit this phenomenon and show that it is robust to a variety of fan types, phone types, and background audio environments, consistently producing voltage estimations within +/- 2%. We also show that our method works for smartphones as well as feature phones, making it applicable in a wide range of settings.",COMPASS
Lagrangian Relaxation Techniques for Scalable Spatial Conservation Planning,2012,We address the problem of spatial conservation planning in which the goal is to maximize the expected spread of cascades of an endangered species by strategically purchasing land parcels within a given budget. This problem can be solved by standard integer programming methods using the sample average approximation (SAA) scheme. Our main contribution lies in exploiting the separable structure present in this problem and using Lagrangian relaxation techniques to gain scalability over the flat representation. We also generalize the approach to allow the application of the SAA scheme to a range of stochastic optimization problems. Our iterative approach is highly efficient in terms of space requirements and it provides an upper bound over the optimal solution at each iteration. We apply our approach to the Red-cockaded Woodpecker conservation problem. The results show that it can find the optimal solution significantly faster---sometimes by an order-of-magnitude---than using the flat representation for a range of budget sizes.,AAAI
Scheduling Conservation Designs via Network Cascade Optimization,2012,"We introduce the problem of scheduling land purchases to conserve an endangered species in a way that achieves maximum population spread but delays purchases as long as possible, so that conservation planners retain maximum flexibility and use available budgets in the most efficient way. We develop the problem formally as a stochastic optimization problem over a network cascade model describing the population spread, and present a solution approach that reduces the stochastic problem to a novel variant of a Steiner tree problem. We give a primal-dual algorithm for the problem that computes both a feasible solution and a bound on the quality of an optimal solution. Our experiments, using actual conservation data and a standard diffusion model, show that the approach produces near optimal results and is much more scalable than more generic off-the-shelf optimizers.",AAAI
Fast Combinatorial Algorithm for Optimizing the Spread of Cascades,2015,"We address a spatial conservation planning problem in which the planner purchases a budget-constrained set of land parcels in order to maximize the expected spread of a population of an endangered species.

Online Optimization with Dynamic Temporal Uncertainty: Incorporating Short Term Predictions for Renewable Integration in Intelligent Energy Systems,2013,"Growing costs, environmental awareness and government directives have set the stage for an increase in the fraction of electricity supplied using intermittent renewable sources such as solar and wind energy. To compensate for the increased variability in supply and demand, we need algorithms for online energy resource allocation under temporal uncertainty of future consumption and availability. Recent advances in prediction algorithms offer hope that a reduction in future uncertainty, through short term predictions, will increase the worth of the renewables. Predictive information is then revealed incrementally in an online manner, leading to what we call dynamic temporal uncertainty. We demonstrate the non-triviality of this problem and provide online algorithms, both randomized and deterministic, to handle time varying uncertainty in future rewards for non-stationary MDPs in general and for energy resource allocation in particular. We derive theoretical upper and lower bounds that hold even for a finite horizon, and establish that, in the deterministic case, discounting future rewards can be used as a strategy to maximize the total (undiscounted) reward. We also corroborate the efficacy of our methodology using wind and demand traces.",AAAI
Designing a Marketplace for the Trading and Distribution of Energy in the Smart Grid (Page 1285),2015,"Decentralized energy production is meant to reduce generation and distribution inefficiencies, leading to major economic and environmental benefits. This new model is meant to be supported by smart grids, electricity networks that can intelligently integrate the actions of all users connected to them - generators, consumers, and prosumers (those that do both) - to efficiently deliver sustainable, economic and secure electricity supplies. A major research challenge is the design of markets for prosumers in smart grids that consider distribution grid constraints. This paper introduces a novel market that allows prosumers to trade electricity while satisfying the constraints of the grid. Our market's allocation rule is implemented by means of the so-called RADPRO, an efficient dynamic programming algorithm that assesses in polynomial time how much energy each prosumer trades as well as how energy must be distributed throughout the grid. Our empirical results show that RADPRO significantly outperforms both CPLEX and Gurobi in solving time when computing the optimal allocation over acyclic networks. Furthermore, the message-passing nature of RADPRO offers the possibility of running our market in a decentralized (peer-to-peer) manner.",AAMAS
Species Distribution Modeling of Citizen Science Data as a Classification Problem with Class-Conditional Noise,2017,"Species distribution models relate the geographic occurrence pattern of a species to environmental features and are used for a variety of scientific and management purposes. One source of data for building species distribution models is citizen science, in which volunteers report locations where they observed (or did not observe) sets of species. Since volunteers have variable levels of expertise, citizen science data may contain both false positives and false negatives in the location labels (present vs. absent) they provide, but many common modeling approaches for this task do not address these sources of noise explicitly. In this paper, we propose to formulate the species distribution modeling task as a classification problem with class-conditional noise. Our approach builds on other applications of class-conditional noise models to crowdsourced data, but we focus on leveraging features of the noise processes that are distinct from the class features. We describe the conditions under which the parameters of our proposed model are identifiable and apply it to simulated data and data from the eBird citizen science project.",AAAI
A probabilistic model for personalized tag prediction,2010,"Social tagging systems have become increasingly popular for sharing and organizing web resources. Tag prediction is a common feature of social tagging systems. Social tagging by nature is an incremental process, meaning that once a user has saved a web page with tags, the tagging system can provide more accurate predictions for the user, based on user's incremental behaviors. However, existing tag prediction methods do not consider this important factor, in which their training and test datasets are either split by a fixed time stamp or randomly sampled from a larger corpus. In our temporal experiments, we perform a time-sensitive sampling on an existing public dataset, resulting in a new scenario which is much closer to ""real-world"".
 In this paper, we address the problem of tag prediction by proposing a probabilistic model for personalized tag prediction. The model is a Bayesian approach, and integrates three factors - ego-centric effect, environmental effects and web page content. Two methods - both intuitive calculation and learning optimization - are provided for parameter estimation. Pure graphbased methods which may have significant constraints (such as every user, every item and every tag has to occur in at least p posts), cannot make a prediction in most of ""real world"" cases while our model improves the F-measure by over 30% compared to a leading algorithm, in our ""real-world"" use case.",KDD
Modeling the Management of Water Resources Systems Using Multi-Objective DCOPs (Page 821),2015,"Multi-agent systems are being increasingly used in environmental modeling applications to characterize human behavior and interactions with natural processes. A model based on Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) has been recently proposed for studying the management of water resources systems from the point of view of a regulating institution in charge of coordinating multiple distributed decision-makers (agents). However, this DCOP-based model does not explicitly account for the variety of stakeholders' and regulators' interests that are generally involved, representing incommensurable and often competing objectives. In this paper, we provide a Multi-Objective DCOP (MODCOP) model that supports distributed water resources management through the exploration of tradeoffs across different agents' objectives. Among the available algorithms for solving the resulting MO-DCOP, we choose a variant of the B-MOMS algorithm because it allows identifying (an approximation of) the whole Pareto frontier for the problem. Experimental results conducted on a number of randomly generated water systems show that the approximation introduced by the solving algorithm is limited for most of the systems.",AAMAS
A Personalised Thermal Comfort Model Using a Bayesian Network,2015,"In this paper, we address the challenge of predicting optimal comfort temperatures of individual users of a smart heating system. At present, such systems use simple models of user comfort when deciding on a set point temperature. These models generally fail to adapt to an individual userÃ¢â¬â¢s preferences, resulting in poor estimates of a userÃ¢â¬â¢s preferred temperature. To address this issue, we propose a personalised thermal comfort model that uses a Bayesian network to learn and adapt to a userÃ¢â¬â¢s individual preferences. Through an empirical evaluation based on the ASHRAE RP-884 data set, we show that our model is consistently 17.5- 23.5% more accurate than current models, regardless of environmental conditions and the type of heating system used. Our model is not limited to a single metric but can also infer information about expected user feedback, optimal comfort temperature and thermal sensitivity at the same time, which can be used to reduce energy used for heating with minimal comfort loss.",IJCAI
Discovering Life Cycle Assessment Trees from Impact Factor Databases,2011,"In recent years, environmental sustainability has received widespread attention due to continued depletion of natural resources and degradation of the environment. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a methodology for quantifying multiple environmental impacts of a product, across its entire life cycle Ã¢â¬â from creation to use to discard. The key object of interest in LCA is the inventory tree, with the desired product as the root node and the materials and processes used across its life cycle as the children. The total impact of the parent in any environmental category is a linear combination of the impacts of the children in that category. LCA has generally been used in ""forward: mode: given an inventory tree and impact factors of its children, the task is to compute the impact factors of the root, i.e., the product being modeled. We propose a data mining approach to solve the inverse problem, where the task is to infer inventory trees from a database of environmental factors. This is an important problem with applications in not just understanding what parts and processes constitute a product but also in designing and developing more sustainable alternatives. Our solution methodology is one of feature selection but set in the context of a non-negative least squares problem. It organizes numerous non-negative least squares fits over the impact factor database into a set of pairwise membership relations which are then summarized into candidate trees in turn yielding a consensus tree. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach over real LCA datasets obtained from a large computer manufacturer.",AAAI
Turning down the noise in the blogosphere,2009,"In recent years, the blogosphere has experienced a substantial increase in the number of posts published daily, forcing users to cope with information overload. The task of guiding users through this flood of information has thus become critical. To address this issue, we present a principled approach for picking a set of posts that best covers the important stories in the blogosphere.
 We define a simple and elegant notion of coverage and formalize it as a submodular optimization problem, for which we can efficiently compute a near-optimal solution. In addition, since people have varied interests, the ideal coverage algorithm should incorporate user preferences in order to tailor the selected posts to individual tastes. We define the problem of learning a personalized coverage function by providing an appropriate user-interaction model and formalizing an online learning framework for this task. We then provide a no-regret algorithm which can quickly learn a user's preferences from limited feedback.
 We evaluate our coverage and personalization algorithms extensively over real blog data. Results from a user study show that our simple coverage algorithm does as well as most popular blog aggregation sites, including Google Blog Search, Yahoo! Buzz, and Digg. Furthermore, we demonstrate empirically that our algorithm can successfully adapt to user preferences. We believe that our technique, especially with personalization, can dramatically reduce information overload.",KDD
Assembler: Efficient Discovery of Spatial Co-evolving Patterns in Massive Geo-sensory Data,2015,"Recent years have witnessed the wide proliferation of geo-sensory applications wherein a bundle of sensors are deployed at different locations to cooperatively monitor the target condition. Given massive geo-sensory data, we study the problem of mining spatial co-evolving patterns (SCPs), i.e., groups of sensors that are spatially correlated and co-evolve frequently in their readings. SCP mining is of great importance to various real-world applications, yet it is challenging because (1) the truly interesting evolutions are often flooded by numerous trivial fluctuations in the geo-sensory time series; and (2) the pattern search space is extremely large due to the spatiotemporal combinatorial nature of SCP. In this paper, we propose a two-stage method called Assember. In the first stage, Assember filters trivial fluctuations using wavelet transform and detects frequent evolutions for individual sensors via a segment-and-group approach. In the second stage, Assember generates SCPs by assembling the frequent evolutions of individual sensors. Leveraging the spatial constraint, it conceptually organizes all the SCPs into a novel structure called the SCP search tree, which facilitates the effective pruning of the search space to generate SCPs efficiently. Our experiments on both real and synthetic data sets show that Assember is effective, efficient, and scalable.",KDD
Suggesting Email View Filters for Triage and Search,2009,"Growing email volumes cause flooded inboxes and swelled email archives, making search and new email processing difficult. While emails have rich metadata, such as recipients and folders, suitable for creating filtered views, it is often difficult to choose appropriate filters for new inbox messages without first examining messages. In this work, we consider a system that automatically suggests relevant view filters to the user for the currently viewed messages. We propose several ranking algorithms for suggesting useful filters. Our work suggests that such systems quickly filter groups of inbox messages and find messages more easily during search.",IJCAI
Sustaining Economic Exploitation of Complex Ecosystems in Computational Models of Coupled Human-Natural Networks,2012,"Understanding ecological complexity has stymied scientists for decades. Recent elucidation of the famously coined ""devious strategies for stability in enduring natural systems"" has opened up a new field of computational analyses of complex ecological networks where the nonlinear dynamics of many interacting species can be more realistically modeled and understood. Here, we describe the first extension of this field to include coupled human-natural systems. This extension elucidates new strategies for sustaining extraction of biomass (e.g., fish, forests, fiber) from ecosystems that account for ecological complexity and can pursue multiple goals such as maximizing economic profit, employment and carbon sequestration by ecosystems. Our more realistic modeling of ecosystems helps explain why simpler ""maximum sustainable yield"" bioeconomic models underpinning much natural resource extraction policy leads to less profit, biomass, and biodiversity than predicted by those simple models. Current research directions of this integrated natural and social science include applying artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and multiplayer online games.",AAAI
Robust Decision Making for Stochastic Network Design,2016,"We address the problem of robust decision making for stochastic network design. Our work is motivated by spatial conservation planning where the goal is to take management decisions within a fixed budget to maximize the expected spread of a population of species over a network of land parcels. Most previous work for this problem assumes that accurate estimates of different network parameters (edge activation probabilities, habitat suitability scores) are available, which is an unrealistic assumption. To address this shortcoming, we assume that network parameters are only partially known, specified via interval bounds. We then develop a decision making approach that computes the solution with minimax regret. We provide new theoretical results regarding the structure of the minmax regret solution which help develop a computationally efficient approach. Empirically, we show that previous approaches that work on point estimates of network parameters result in high regret on several standard benchmarks, while our approach provides significantly more robust solutions.",AAAI
PAC Optimal Planning for Invasive Species Management: Improved Exploration for Reinforcement Learning from Simulator-Defined MDPs,2013,"Often the most practical way to define a Markov Decision Process (MDP) is as a simulator that, given a state and an action, produces a resulting state and immediate reward sampled from the corresponding distributions.Simulators in natural resource management can be very expensive to execute, so that the time required to solve such MDPs is dominated by the number of calls to the simulator. This paper presents an algorithm, DDV, that combines improved confidence intervals on the Q values (as in interval estimation) with a novel upper bound on the discounted state occupancy probabilities to intelligently choose state-action pairs to explore. We prove that this algorithm terminates with a policy whose value is within epsilon of the optimal policy (with probability 1-delta) after making only polynomially-many calls to the simulator.Experiments on one benchmark MDP and on an MDP for invasive species management show very large reductions in the number of simulator calls required.",AAAI
Incentive Schemes for Participatory Sensing (Page 1081),2015,"We consider a participatory sensing scenario where a group of private sensors observes the same phenomenon, such as air pollution. Since sensors need to be installed and maintained, owners of sensors are inclined to provide inaccurate or random data. We design a novel payment mechanism that incentivizes honest behavior by scoring sensors based on the quality of their reports. The basic principle follows the standard Bayesian Truth Serum (BTS) paradigm, where highest rewards are obtained for reports that are surprisingly common. The mechanism, however, eliminates the main drawback of the BTS in a sensing scenario since it does not require sensors to report predictions regarding the overall distribution of sensors' measurements. As it is the case with other peer prediction methods, the mechanism admits uninformed equilibria. However, in the novel mechanism these equilibria result in worse payoff than truthful reporting.",AAMAS

Aggregating Electric Cars to Sustainable Virtual Power Plants: The Value of Flexibility in Future Electricity Markets,2015,"Electric vehicles will play a crucial role in balancing the future electrical grid, which is complicated by many intermittent renewable energy sources. We developed an algorithm that determines for a fleet of electric vehicles, which EV at what price and location to commit to the operating reserve market to either absorb excess capacity or provide electricity during shortages (vehicle-2-grid). The algorithm takes the value of immobility into account by using carsharing fees as a reference point. A virtual power plant autonomously replaces cars that are committed to the operating reserves and are then rented out, with other idle cars to pool the risks of uncertainty. We validate our model with data from a free float carsharing fleet of 500 electric vehicles. An analysis of expected future developments (2015, 2018, and 2022) in operating reserve demand and battery costs yields that the gross profits for a carsharing operator increase between 7-12% with a negligible decrease in car availability (<0.01%).",AAAI
Autonomous Agents in Future Energy Markets: The 2012 Power Trading Agent Competition,2013,"Sustainable energy systems of the future will need more than efficient, clean, and low-cost energy sources. They will also need efficient price signals that motivate sustainable energy consumption behaviors and a tight real-time alignment of energy demand with supply from renewable and traditional sources. The Power Trading Agent Competition (Power TAC) is a rich, competitive, open-source simulation platform for future retail power markets built on real-world data and state-of-the-art customer models. Its purpose is to help researchers understand the dynamics of customer and retailer decision-making as well as the robustness of proposed market designs. Power TAC invites researchers to develop autonomous electricity broker agents and to pit them against best-in-class strategies in globalcompetitions, the first of which will be held at AAAI 2013. Power TAC competitions provide compelling, actionable information for policy makers and industry leaders.

Cooperatives of Distributed Energy Resources for Efficient Virtual Power Plants,2011,"The creation of Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) has been suggested in recentyears as the means for achieving the cost-efficient integration of the manydistributed energy resources (DERs) that are starting to emerge in the elec-tricity network. In this work, we contribute to the development of VPPs byoffering a game-theoretic perspective to the problem. Specifically, we de-signcooperatives(or âcooperative VPPsââCVPPs) of rational autonomousDER-agents representing small-to-medium size renewable electricity pro-ducers, which coalesce to profitably sell their energy to theelectricity grid.By so doing, we help to counter the fact that individual DERs are often ex-cluded from the wholesale energy market due to their perceived inefficiencyand unreliability. We discuss the issues surrounding the emergence of suchcooperatives, and propose a pricing mechanism with certaindesirable prop-erties. Specifically, our mechanism guarantees that CVPPs have the incen-tive to truthfully report to the grid accurate estimates of their electricityproduction, and that larger rather than smaller CVPPs form;this promotesCVPP efficiency and reliability. In addition, we propose a scheme to allo-cate payments within the cooperative, and show that, given this scheme andthe pricing mechanism, the allocation is in the core and, as such, no subsetof members has a financial incentive to break away from the CVPP. More-over, we develop an analytical tool for quantifying the uncertainty aboutDER production estimates, and distinguishing among different types of er-rors regarding such estimates. We then utilize this tool to devise protocolsto manage CVPP membership. Finally, we demonstrate these ideas througha simulation that uses real-world data.",AAMAS
Online Mechanisms for Charging Electric Vehicles in Settings with Varying Marginal Electricity Costs,2015,"We propose new mechanisms that can be used by a demand response aggregator to flexibly shift the charging of electric vehicles (EVs) to times where cheap but intermittent renewable energy is in high supply. Here, it is important to consider the constraints and preferences of EV owners, while eliminating the scope for strategic behaviour. To achieve this, we propose, for the first time, a generic class of incentive mechanisms for settings with both varying marginal electricity costs and multidimensional preferences. We show these are dominant strategy incentive compatible, i.e., EV owners are incentivised to report their constraints and preferences truthfully. We also detail a specific instance of this class, show that it achieves Ã¢â°Ë98% of the optimal in realistic scenarios and demonstrate how it can be adapted to trade off efficiency with profit.",IJCAI
Multiagent Coordination for Energy Consumption Scheduling in Consumer Cooperatives,2013,"A key challenge to create a sustainable and energy-efficient society is in making consumer demand adaptive to energy supply, especially renewable supply. In this paper, we propose a partially-centralized organization of consumers, namely, a consumer cooperative for purchasing electricity from the market. We propose a novel multiagent coordination algorithm to shape the energy consumption of the cooperative. In the cooperative, a central coordinator buys the electricity for the whole group and consumers make their own consumption decisions based on their private consumption constraints and preferences. To coordinate individual consumers under incomplete information, we propose an iterative algorithm in which a virtual price signal is sent by the coordinator to induce consumers to shift demand. We prove that our algorithm converges to the central optimal solution. Additionally we analyze the convergence rate of the algorithm via simulations on randomly generated instances. The results indicate scalability with respect to the number of agents and consumption slots.",AAAI
Energy- and Cost-Efficient Pumping Station Control,2016,"With renewable energy becoming more common, energy prices fluctuate more depending on environmental factors such as the weather. Consuming energy without taking volatile prices into consideration can not only become expensive, but may also increase the peak load, which requires energy providers to generate additional energy using less environment-friendly methods. In the Netherlands, pumping stations that maintain the water levels of polder canals are large energy consumers, but the controller software currently used in the industry does not take real-time energy availability into account. We investigate if existing AI planning techniques have the potential to improve upon the current solutions. In particular, we propose a light weight but realistic simulator and investigate if an online planning method (UCT) can utilise this simulator to improve the cost-efficiency of pumping station control policies. An empirical comparison with the current control algorithms indicates that substantial cost, and thus peak load, reduction can be attained.",AAAI
Near-Optimal Decentralized Power Supply Restoration in Smart Grids (Page 1275),2015,"Next generation of smart grids face a number of challenges including co-generation from intermittent renewable power sources, a shift away from monolithic control due to increased market deregulation, and robust operation in the face of disasters. Such heterogeneous nature and high operational readiness requirement of smart grids necessitates decentralized control for critical tasks such as power supply restoration (PSR) after line failures. We present a novel multiagent system based approach for PSR using Lagrangian dual decomposition. Our approach works on general graphs, provides provable quality-bounds and requires only local message-passing among different connected sub-regions of a smart grid, enabling decentralized control. Using these quality bounds, we show that our approach can provide near-optimal solutions on a number of large real-world and synthetic benchmarks. Our approach compares favorably both in solution quality and scalability with previous best multiagent PSR approach.",AAMAS
Deep Latent Generative Models for Energy Disaggregation,2019,"Thoroughly understanding how energy consumption is disaggregated into individual appliances can help reduce household expenses, integrate renewable sources of energy, and lead to efficient use of energy. In this work, we propose a deep latent generative model based on variational recurrent neural networks (VRNNs) for energy disaggregation. Our model jointly disaggregates the aggregated energy signal into individual appliance signals, achieving superior performance when compared to the state-of-the-art models for energy disaggregation, yielding a 29% and 41% performance improvement on two energy datasets, respectively, without explicitly encoding temporal/contextual information or heuristics. Our model also achieves better prediction performance on lowpower appliances, paving the way for a more nuanced disaggregation model. The structured output prediction in our model helps in accurately discerning which appliance(s) contribute to the aggregated power consumption, thus providing a more useful and meaningful disaggregation model.",AAAI
Pattern Decomposition with Complex Combinatorial Constraints: Application to Materials Discovery,2015,"Identifying important components or factors in large amounts of noisy data is a key problem in machine learning and data mining. Motivated by a pattern decomposition problem in materials discovery, aimed at discovering new materials for renewable energy, e.g. for fuel and solar cells, we introduce CombiFD, a framework for factor based pattern decomposition that allows the incorporation of a-priori knowledge as constraints, including complex combinatorial constraints. In addition, we propose a new pattern decomposition algorithm, called AMIQO, based on solving a sequence of (mixed-integer) quadratic programs. Our approach considerably outperforms the state of the art on the materials discovery problem, scaling to larger datasets and recovering more precise and physically meaningful decompositions. We also show the effectiveness of our approach for enforcing background knowledge on other application domains.",AAAI
Fine-Grained Photovoltaic Output Prediction Using a Bayesian Ensemble,2012,"Local and distributed power generation is increasingly relianton renewable power sources, e.g., solar (photovoltaic or PV) andwind energy. The integration of such sources into the power grid ischallenging, however, due to their variable and intermittent energyoutput. To effectively use them on alarge scale, it is essential to be able to predict power generation at afine-grained level. We describe a novel Bayesian ensemble methodologyinvolving three diverse predictors. Each predictor estimates mixingcoefficients for integrating PV generation output profiles but capturesfundamentally different characteristics. Two of them employ classicalparameterized (naive Bayes) and non-parametric (nearest neighbor) methods tomodel the relationship between weather forecasts and PV output. The thirdpredictor captures the sequentiality implicit in PV generation and uses motifsmined from historical data to estimate the most likely mixture weights usinga stream prediction methodology. We demonstrate the success and superiority of ourmethods on real PV data from two locations that exhibit diverse weatherconditions. Predictions from our model can be harnessed to optimize schedulingof delay tolerant workloads, e.g., in a data center.",AAAI
Factored Models for Multiscale Decision-Making in Smart Grid Customers,2012,"Active participation of customers in the management of demand, and renewable energy supply, is a critical goal of the Smart Grid vision. However, this is a complex problem with numerous scenarios that are difficult to test in field projects. Rich and scalable simulations are required to develop effective strategies and policies that elicit desirable behavior from customers. We present a versatile agent-based ""factored model"" that enables rich simulation scenarios across distinct customer types and varying agent granularity. We formally characterize the decisions to be made by Smart Grid customers as a multiscale decision-making problem and show how our factored model representation handles several temporal and contextual decisions by introducing a novel ""utility optimizing agent."" We further contribute innovative algorithms for (i) statistical learning-based hierarchical Bayesian timeseries simulation, and (ii) adaptive capacity control using decision-theoretic approximation of multiattribute utility functions over multiple agents. Prominent among the approaches being studied to achieve active customer participation is one based on offering customers financial incentives through variable-price tariffs; we also contribute an effective solution to the problem of ""customer herding"" under such tariffs. We support our contributions with experimental results from simulations based on real-world data on an open Smart Grid simulation platform.",AAAI
TacTex'13: A Champion Adaptive Power Trading Agent,2014,"Sustainable energy systems of the future will no longer be able to rely on the current paradigm that energy supply follows demand. Many of the renewable energy resources do not produce power on demand, and therefore there is a need for new market structures that motivate sustainable behaviors by participants. The Power Trading Agent Competition (Power TAC) is a new annual competition that focuses on the design and operation of future retail power markets, specifically in smart grid environments with renewable energy production, smart metering, and autonomous agents acting on behalf of customers and retailers. It uses a rich, open-source simulation platform that is based on real-world data and state-of-the-art customer models. Its purpose is to help researchers understand the dynamics of customer and retailer decision-making, as well as the robustness of proposed market designs. This paper introduces TacTex'13, the champion agent from the inaugural competition in 2013.

Planning with MIP for Supply Restoration in Power Distribution Systems,2013,"The next generation of power systems faces significant challenges, both in coping with increased loading of an aging infrastructure and incorporating renewable energy sources. Meeting these challenges requires a fundamental change in the operation of power systems by replacing human-in-the-loop operations with autonomous systems. This is especially acute in distribution systems, where renewable integration often occurs. This paper investigates the automation of power supply restoration (PSR), that is, the process of optimally reconfiguring a faulty distribution grid to resupply customers. The key contributions of the paper are (1) a flexible mixed-integer programming framework for solving PSR, (2) a model decomposition to obtain high-quality solutions within the required time constraints, and (3) an experimental validation of the potential benefits of the proposed PSR operations.",IJCAI
Decentralised Control of Micro-Storage in the Smart Grid,2011,"In this paper, we propose a novel decentralised control mechanism to manage micro-storage in the smart grid. Our approach uses an adaptive pricing scheme that energy suppliers apply to home smart agents controlling micro-storage devices. In particular, we prove that the interaction between a supplier using our pricing scheme and the actions of selfish micro-storage agents forms a globally stable feedback loop that converges to an efficient equilibrium. We further propose a market strategy that allows the supplier to reduce wholesale purchasing costs without increasing the uncertainty and variance for its aggregate consumer demand. Moreover, we empirically evaluate our mechanism (based on the UK grid data) and show that it yields savings of up to 16% in energy cost for consumers using storage devices with average capacity 10 kWh. Furthermore, we show that it is robust against extreme system changes.",AAAI
Complex-Demand Knapsack Problems and Incentives in AC Power Systems (Page 973),2013,"We consider AC electrical systems where each electrical device has a power demand expressed as a complex number, and there is a limit on the magnitude of total power supply. Motivated by this scenario, we introduce the complex-demand knapsack problem (C-KP), a new variation of the traditional knapsack problem, where each item is associated with a demand as a complex number, rather than a real number often interpreted as weight or size of the item. While keeping the same goal as to maximize the sum of values of the selected items, we put the capacity limit on the magnitude of the sum of satisfied demands. For C-KP, we prove its inapproximability by FPTAS (unless P = NP), as well as presenting a (1/2-e)-approximation algorithm. Furthermore, we investigate the selfish multi-agent setting where each agent is in charge of one item, and an agent may misreport the demand and value of his item for his own interest. We show a simple way to adapt our approximation algorithm to be monotone, which is sufficient for the existence of incentive compatible payments such that no agent has an incentive to misreport. Our results shed insight on the design of multi-agent systems for smart grid.",AAMAS
Batch Reinforcement Learning for Smart Home Energy Management,2015,"Smart grids enhance power grids by integrating electronic equipment, communication systems and computational tools. In a smart grid, consumers can insert energy into the power grid. We propose a new energy management system (called RLbEMS) that autonomously defines a policy for selling or storing energy surplus in smart homes. This policy is achieved through Batch Reinforcement Learning with historical data about energy prices, energy generation, consumer demand and characteristics of storage systems. In practical problems, RLbEMS has learned good energy selling policies quickly and effectively. We obtained maximum gains of 20.78% and 10.64%, when compared to a Naive-greedy policy, for smart homes located in Brazil and in the USA, respectively. Another important result achieved by RLbEMS was the reduction of about 30% of peak demand, a central desideratum for smart grids.",IJCAI
An Active Learning Approach to Home Heating in the Smart Grid,2013,"A key issue for the realization of the smart grid vision is the implementation of effective demand-side management. One possible approach involves exposing dynamic energy prices to end-users. In this paper, we consider a resulting problem on the user's side: how to adaptively heat a home given dynamic prices. The user faces the challenge of having to react to dynamic prices in real time, trading off his comfort with the costs of heating his home to a certain temperature. We propose an active learning approach to adjust the home temperature in a semi-automatic way. Our algorithm learns the user's preferences over time and automatically adjusts the temperature in real-time as prices change. In addition, the algorithm asks the user for feedback once a day. To find the best query time, the algorithm solves an optimal stopping problem. Via simulations, we show that our algorithm learns users' preferences quickly, and that using the expected utility loss as the query criterion outperforms standard approaches from the active learning literature.",IJCAI
VidyutVanika: A Reinforcement Learning Based Broker Agent for a Power Trading Competition,2019,"A smart grid is an efficient and sustainable energy system that integrates diverse generation entities, distributed storage capacity, and smart appliances and buildings. A smart grid brings new kinds of participants in the energy market served by it, whose effect on the grid can only be determined through high fidelity simulations. Power TAC offers one such simulation platform using real-world weather data and complex state-of-the-art customer models. In Power TAC, autonomous energy brokers compete to make profits across tariff, wholesale and balancing markets while maintaining the stability of the grid. In this paper, we design an autonomous broker VidyutVanika, the runner-up in the 2018 Power TAC competition. VidyutVanika relies on reinforcement learning (RL) in the tariff market and dynamic programming in the wholesale market to solve modified versions of known Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulations in the respective markets. The novelty lies in defining the reward functions for MDPs, solving these MDPs, and the application of these solutions to real actions in the market. Unlike previous participating agents, VidyutVanika uses a neural network to predict the energy consumption of various customers using weather data. We use several heuristic ideas to bridge the gap between the restricted action spaces of the MDPs and the much more extensive action space available to VidyutVanika. These heuristics allow VidyutVanika to convert near-optimal fixed tariffs to time-of-use tariffs aimed at mitigating transmission capacity fees, spread out its orders across several auctions in the wholesale market to procure energy at a lower price, more accurately estimate parameters required for implementing the MDP solution in the wholesale market, and account for wholesale procurement costs while optimizing tariffs. We use Power TAC 2018 tournament data and controlled experiments to analyze the performance of VidyutVanika, and illustrate the efficacy of the above strategies.",AAAI
Novel geospatial interpolation analytics for general meteorological measurements,2014,"This paper addresses geospatial interpolation for meteorological measurements in which we estimate the values of climatic metrics at unsampled sites with existing observations. Providing climatological and meteorological conditions covering a large region is potentially useful in many applications, such as smart grid. However, existing research works on interpolation either cause a large number of complex calculations or are lack of high accuracy. We propose a Bayesian compressed sensing based non-parametric statistical model to efficiently perform the spatial interpolation task. Student-t priors are employed to model the sparsity of unknown signals' coefficients, and the Approximated Variational Inference (AVI) method is provided for effective and fast learning. The presented model has been deployed at IBM, targeting for aiding the intelligent management of smart grid. The evaluations on two real world datasets demonstrate that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in both effectiveness and efficiency.",KDD
Multi-Entity Dependence Learning with Rich Context via Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder,2018,"Multi-Entity Dependence Learning (MEDL) explores conditional correlations among multiple entities. The availability of rich contextual information requires a nimble learning scheme that tightly integrates with deep neural networks and has the ability to capture correlation structures among exponentially many outcomes. We propose MEDL_CVAE, which encodes a conditional multivariate distribution as a generating process. As a result, the variational lower bound of the joint likelihood can be optimized via a conditional variational auto-encoder and trained end-to-end on GPUs. Our MEDL_CVAE was motivated by two real-world applications in computational sustainability: one studies the spatial correlation among multiple bird species using the eBird data and the other models multi-dimensional landscape composition and human footprint in the Amazon rainforest with satellite images. We show that MEDL_CVAE captures rich dependency structures, scales better than previous methods, and further improves on the joint likelihood taking advantage of very large datasets that are beyond the capacity of previous methods.",AAAI
Gpu-Accelerated Principal-Agent Game For Scalable Citizen Science,2019,"Citizen science programs have been instrumental in boosting sustainability projects, large-scale scientific discovery, and crowd-sourced experimentation. Nevertheless, these programs witness challenges in submissions' quality, such as sampling bias resulting from citizens' preferences to complete some tasks over others. The sampling bias frequently manifests itself in the program's dataset as spatially clustered submissions, which reduce the efficacy of the dataset for subsequent scientific studies. To address the spatial clustering problem, programs use reward schemes obtained from game-theoretical models to incentivize citizens to perform tasks that are more meaningful from a scientific point of view. Herein we propose a GPU-accelerated approach for the Avicaching game, which was recently introduced by the eBird citizen science program to incentivize birdwatchers to collect bird data from under-sampled locations. Avicaching is a Principal-Agent game, in which the principal corresponds to the citizen science program (eBird) and the agents to the birdwatchers or citizen scientists. Previous approaches for solving the Avicaching game used approximations based on mixed-integer programming and knapsack algorithms combined with learning algorithms, using standard CPU hardware. Following the recent advances in scalable deep learning and parallel computation on Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), we propose a novel approach to solve the Avicaching game, which takes advantage of neural networks and parallelism for large-scale games. We demonstrate that our approach better captures agents' behavior, which allows better learning and more effective incentive distribution in a real-world bird observation dataset. Our approach also allows for massive speedups using GPUs. As Avicaching is representative of games that are aimed at reducing spatial clustering in citizen science programs, our scalable reformulation for Avicaching enables citizen science programs to tackle sampling bias and improve submission quality on a large scale.",COMPASS
Efficiently Approximating the Pareto Frontier: Hydropower Dam Placement in the Amazon Basin,2018,"Real-world problems are often not fully characterized by a single optimal solution, as they frequently involve multiple competing objectives; it is therefore important to identify the so-called Pareto frontier, which captures solution trade-offs. We propose a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme based on Dynamic Programming (DP) for computing a polynomially succinct curve that approximates the Pareto frontier to within an arbitrarily small epsilon > 0 on tree-structured networks. Given a set of objectives, our approximation scheme runs in time polynomial in the size of the instance and 1/epsilon. We also propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) scheme to approximate the Pareto frontier. The DP and MIP Pareto frontier approaches have complementary strengths and are surprisingly effective. We provide empirical results showing that our methods outperform other approaches in efficiency and accuracy. Our work is motivated by a problem in computational sustainability concerning the proliferation of hydropower dams throughout the Amazon basin. Our goal is to support decision-makers in evaluating impacted ecosystem services on the full scale of the Amazon basin. Our work is general and can be applied to approximate the Pareto frontier of a variety of multiobjective problems on tree-structured networks.",AAAI
Scalable Relaxations of Sparse Packing Constraints: Optimal Biocontrol in Predator-Prey Networks,2018,"Cascades represent rapid changes in networks. A cascading phenomenon of ecological and economic impact is the spread of invasive species in geographic landscapes. The most promising management strategy is often biocontrol, which entails introducing a natural predator able to control the invading population, a setting that can be treated as two interacting cascades of predator and prey populations. We formulate and study a nonlinear problem of optimal biocontrol: optimally seeding the predator cascade over time to minimize the harmful prey population. Recurring budgets, which typically face conservation organizations, naturally leads to sparse constraints which make the problem amenable to approximation algorithms. Available methods based on continuous relaxations scale poorly, to remedy this we develop a novel and scalable randomized algorithm based on a width relaxation, applicable to a broad class of combinatorial optimization problems. We evaluate our contributions in the context of biocontrol for the insect pest Hemlock Wolly Adelgid (HWA) in eastern North America. Our algorithm outperforms competing methods in terms of scalability and solution quality and finds near-optimal strategies for the control of the HWA for fine-grained networks -- an important problem in computational sustainability.",AAAI
Robust Optimization for Tree-Structured Stochastic Network Design,2017,"Stochastic network design is a general framework for optimizing network connectivity. It has several applications in computational sustainability including spatial conservation planning, pre-disaster network preparation, and river network optimization. A common assumption in previous work has been made that network parameters (e.g., probability of species colonization) are precisely known, which is unrealistic in real- world settings. We therefore address the robust river network design problem where the goal is to optimize river connectivity for fish movement by removing barriers. We assume that fish passability probabilities are known only imprecisely, but are within some interval bounds. We then develop a planning approach that computes the policies with either high robust ratio or low regret. Empirically, our approach scales well to large river networks. We also provide insights into the solutions generated by our robust approach, which has significantly higher robust ratio than the baseline solution with mean parameter estimates.",AAAI
Spatio-Temporal Consistency as a Means to Identify Unlabeled Objects in a Continuous Data Field,2014,"Mesoscale ocean eddies are a critical component of the Earth System as they dominate the ocean's kinetic energy and impact the global distribution of oceanic heat, salinity, momentum, and nutrients. Therefore, accurately representing these dynamic features is critical for our planet's sustainability. The majority of methods that identify eddies from satellite observations analyze the data in a frame-by-frame basis despite the fact that eddies are dynamic objects that propagate across space and time. We introduce the notion of spatio-temporal consistency to identify eddies in a continuous spatio-temporal field, to simultaneously ensure that the features detected are both spatially and temporally consistent. Our spatio-temporal consistency approach allows us to remove most of the expert criteria used in traditional methods to reduce false negatives. The removal of arbitrary heuristics enables us to render more complete eddy dynamics by identifying smaller and longer lived eddies compared to existing methods.",AAAI
Supervised Scoring with Monotone Multidimensional Splines,2014,"Scoring involves the compression of a number of quantitative attributes into a single meaningful value. We consider the problem of how to generate scores in a setting where they should be weakly monotone (either non-increasing or non-decreasing) in their dimensions. Our approach allows an expert to score an arbitrary set of points to produce meaningful, continuous, monotone scores over the entire domain, while exactly interpolating through those inputs. In contrast, existing monotone interpolating methods only work in two dimensions and typically require exhaustive grid input. Our technique significantly lowers the bar to score creation, allowing domain experts to develop mathematically coherent scores. The method is used in practice to create the LEED Performance scores that gauge building sustainability.",AAAI
Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Exploratory Models: Hemisphere-wide species distributions from massively crowdsourced eBird data,2013,"Broad-scale spatiotemporal processes in conservation and sustainability science, such as continent-wide animal movement, occur across a range of spatial and temporal scales. Understanding these processes at multiple scales is crucial for developing and coordinating conservation strategies across national boundaries. In this paper we propose a general class of models we call AdaSTEM, for Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Exploratory Models, that are able to exploit variation in the density of observations while adapting to multiple scales in space and time. We show that this framework is able to efficiently discover multiscale structure when it is present, while retaining predictive performance when absent. We provide an empirical comparison and analysis, offer theoretical insights from the ensemble loss decomposition, and deploy AdaSTEM to estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica) across the Western Hemisphere using massively crowdsourced eBird data.",AAAI
Scaling Mobile Applications Using Interactive-Device User Training,2018,"As smartphones become cheaper and more ubiquitous, they areincreasingly used in global development projects for data collec-tion, processing, and computation-intensive tasks. To sustainablyimplement such solutions, the costs of deployment, overall training,and long-term usage must be considered. In this paper, we examinethe training process and sustainability of mobile application forIntegrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI). We firstreport a comparison of application Mobile-IMCI with the incum-bent paper-based module on accuracy, time, and performance inboth qualitative and quantitative analyses. We then report an initialexploration of techniques to minimize training time and costs byenabling users to learn applications via a method called ""Interactive-Device Training"" or IDT. We show that IDT can yield significantimprovement in training and learning outcomes with reduced errorrates. We conclude that such device-enabled training can reducethe need for explicit training and thus create a more sustainabledevelopment approach.",COMPASS
Two Approximate Dynamic Programming Algorithms for Managing Complete SIS Networks,2018,"Inspired by the problem of best managing the invasive mosquito Aedes albopictus across the 17 Torres Straits islands of Australia, we aim at solving a Markov decision process on large Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) networks that are highly connected. While dynamic programming approaches can solve sequential decision-making problems on sparsely connected networks, these approaches are intractable for highly connected networks. Inspired by our case study, we focus on problems where the probability of nodes changing state is low and propose two approximate dynamic programming approaches. The first approach is a modified version of value iteration where only those future states that are similar to the current state are accounted for. The second approach models the state space as continuous instead of binary, with an on-line algorithm that takes advantage of Bellman's adapted equation. We evaluate the resulting policies through simulations and provide a priority order to manage the 17 infested Torres Strait islands. Both algorithms show promise, with the continuous state approach being able to scale up to high dimensionality (50 nodes). This work provides a successful example of how AI algorithms can be designed to tackle challenging computational sustainability problems.",COMPASS
Forecast Oriented Classification of Spatio-Temporal Extreme Events,2013,"In complex dynamic systems, accurate forecasting of extreme events, such as hurricanes, is a highly underdetermined, yet very important sustainability problem. While physics-based models deserve their own merits, they often provide unreliable predictions for variables highly related to extreme events. In this paper, we propose a new supervised machine learning problem, which we call a forecast oriented classification of spatiotemporal extreme events. We formulate three important real-world extreme event classification tasks, including seasonal forecasting of (a) tropical cyclones in Northern Hemisphere, (b) hurricanes and landfalling hurricanes in North Atlantic, and (c) North African rainfall. Corresponding predictor and predict and data sets are constructed. These data present unique characteristics and challenges that could potentially motivate future Artificial Intelligent and Data Mining research.",IJCAI
ÃÂ±-min: A Compact Approximate Solver For Finite-Horizon POMDPs,2015,"In many POMDP applications in computational sustainability, it is important that the computed policy have a simple description, so that it can be easily interpreted by stakeholders and decision makers. One measure of simplicity for POMDP value functions is the number of alpha-vectors required to represent the value function. Existing POMDP methods seek to optimize the accuracy of the value function, which can require a very large number of alpha-vectors. This paper studies methods that allow the user to explore the tradeoff between the accuracy of the value function and the number of alpha-vectors. Building on previous point-based POMDP solvers, this paper introduces a new algorithm (alpha-min) that formulates a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) to calculate approximate solutions for finite-horizon POMDP problems with limited numbers of alpha-vectors. At each time-step, alpha-min calculates alpha-vectors to greedily minimize the gap between current upper and lower bounds of the value function. In doing so, good upper and lower bounds are quickly reached allowing a good approximation of the problem with few alpha-vectors. Experimental results show that alpha-min provides good approximate solutions given a fixed number of alpha-vectors on small benchmark problems, on a larger randomly generated problem, as well as on a computational sustainability problem to best manage the endangered Sumatran tiger.",IJCAI
Three New Algorithms to Solve N-POMDPs,2017,"In many fields in computational sustainability, applications of POMDPs are inhibited by the complexity of the optimal solution. One way of delivering simple solutions is to represent the policy with a small number of alpha-vectors. We would like to find the best possible policy that can be expressed using a fixed number N of alpha-vectors. We call this the N-POMDP problem. The existing solver alpha-min approximately solves finite-horizon POMDPs with a controllable number of alpha-vectors. However alpha-min is a greedy algorithm without performance guarantees, and it is rather slow. This paper proposes three new algorithms, based on a general approach that we call alpha-min-2. These three algorithms are able to approximately solve N-POMDPs. Alpha-min-2-fast (heuristic) and alpha-min-2-p (with performance guarantees) are designed to complement an existing POMDP solver, while alpha-min-2-solve (heuristic) is a solver itself. Complexity results are provided for each of the algorithms, and they are tested on well-known benchmarks. These new algorithms will help users to interpret solutions to POMDP problems in computational sustainability.",AAAI
Adaptive Deep Models for Incremental Learning: Considering Capacity Scalability and Sustainability,2019,"Recent years have witnessed growing interests in developing deep models for incremental learning. However, existing approaches often utilize the fixed structure and online backpropagation for deep model optimization, which is difficult to be implemented for incremental data scenarios. Indeed, for streaming data, there are two main challenges for building deep incremental models. First, there is a requirement to develop deep incremental models with Capacity Scalability. In other words, the entire training data are not available before learning the task. It is a challenge to make the deep model structure scaling with streaming data for flexible model evolution and faster convergence. Second, since the stream data distribution usually changes in nature (concept drift), there is a constraint for Capacity Sustainability. That is, how to update the model while preserving previous knowledge for overcoming the catastrophic forgetting. To this end, in this paper, we develop an incremental adaptive deep model (IADM) for dealing with the above two capacity challenges in real-world incremental data scenarios. Specifically, IADM provides an extra attention model for the hidden layers, which aims to learn deep models with adaptive depth from streaming data and enables capacity scalability. Also, we address capacity sustainability by exploiting the attention based fisher information matrix, which can prevent the forgetting in consequence. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world data and show that IADM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with a substantial margin. Moreover, we show that IADM has better capacity scalability and sustainability in incremental learning scenarios.",KDD
Parameter Learning for Latent Network Diffusion,2013,"Diffusion processes in networks are increasingly used to model dynamic phenomena such as the spread of information, wildlife, or social influence. Our work addresses the problem of learning the underlying parameters that govern such a diffusion process by observing the time at which nodes become active. A key advantage of our approach is that, unlike previous work, it can tolerate missing observations for some nodes in the diffusion process. Having incomplete observations is characteristic of offline networks used to model the spread of wildlife. We develop an EM algorithm to address parameter learning in such settings. Since both the E and M steps are computationally challenging, we employ a number of optimization methods such as nonlinear and difference-of-convex programming to address these challenges. Evaluation of the approach on the Red-cockaded Woodpecker conservation problem shows that it is highly robust and accurately learns parameters in various settings, even with more than 80% missing data.",IJCAI
The Steiner Multigraph Problem: Wildlife Corridor Design for Multiple Species,2011,"The conservation of wildlife corridors between existing habitat preserves is important for combating the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation facing species of concern. We introduce the Steiner Multigraph Problem to model the problem of minimum-cost wildlife corridor design for multiple species with different landscape requirements. This problem can also model other analogous settings in wireless and social networks. As a generalization of Steiner forest, the goal is to find a minimum-cost subgraph that connects multiple sets of terminals. In contrast to Steiner forest, each set of terminals can only be connected via a subset of the nodes. Generalizing Steiner forest in this way makes the problem NP-hard even when restricted to two pairs of terminals. However, we show that if the node subsets have a nested structure, the problem admits a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm in the number of terminals. We successfully test exact and heuristic solution approaches on a wildlife corridor instance for wolverines and lynx in western Montana, showing that though the problem is computationally hard, heuristics perform well, and provably optimal solutions can still be obtained.",AAAI
Copula Graphical Models for Wind Resource Estimation,2015,"We develop multivariate copulas for modeling multiple joint distributions of wind speeds at a wind farm site and neighboring wind source. A ndimensional Gaussian copula and multiple copula graphical models enhance the quality of the prediction site distribution. The models, in comparison to multiple regression, achieve higher accuracy and lower cost because they require less sensing data.",IJCAI
